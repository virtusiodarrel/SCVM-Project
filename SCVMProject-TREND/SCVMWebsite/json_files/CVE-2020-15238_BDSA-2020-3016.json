    "description": "Blueman is vulnerable to local privilege escalation via argument injection in the `DhcpClient` method. A local attacker can leverage this flaw to gain unauthenticated admin access.",
    "technicalDescription": "It was discovered that the `DhcpClient` method in the `org.blueman.Mechanism` D-Bus interface is vulnerable to argument injection. \n\nThe impact of this vulnerability depends upon the configuration of the system. The issue can be potentially exploited by any local user if **Polkit-1** is disabled and the Blueman version is lower than **2.0.6**. If a later version is in use and **Polkit-1** has been enabled then an attacker would need to utilize the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action in order to achieve exploitation. This action however is limited to privileged users within the `wheel` group of the `shipped rules` file.\n\nWhere systems are using the ISC DHCP client `dhclient` the flaw can be exploited by passing arguments to `ip link` with the interface name. On systems that use `dhcpcd` attackers may run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. \n\nThe issue was mitigated by reconfiguring `DhcpClient` D-Bus methods so that they accept BlueZ network object paths as opposed to network interface names.",
