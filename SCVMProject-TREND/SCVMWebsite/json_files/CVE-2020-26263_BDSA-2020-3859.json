    "title": "tlslite-ng Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Timing Attack in RSA Decryption",
    "description": "tlslite-ng is vulnerable to information exposure via a timing attack. This could allow an attacker to gain information about the decrypted ciphertext.\n\n**Note:** The vendor has stated that all TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists during the key exchange when performing `RSA PKCS#1 v1.5` decryption. tlslite-ng will leak information which can be discovered using a timing attack.\n\nDue to the fact that for public key operation, PKCS padded data must always starts with `0x00 0x02` an attacker can use this knowledge to gain information about the decrypted ciphertext, including the bit length of the decrypted message and the location of the first unexpected byte.\n\n**Note:** The vendor has stated that while the code was fortified, because of peculiarities of Python, it's not possible to fully fix it.",
