    "description": "LibreOffice is vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) due to the improper implementation of security measures. An attacker could cause LibreOffice to fetch remote executable code resources by tricking a victim into opening a crafted document.\ninclude remote resources within a document by providing crafted input.",
    "technicalDescription": "LibreOffice can be configured to utilize `stealth mode`, which prevents documents from retrieving remote resources by default. This means that documents can only retrieve remote resources if the document resides inside a trusted location. LibreOffice also implements a feature that allows graphics to be used as bullet points. The aforementioned stealth mode safety mechanism is not correctly applied to graphic bullets such that remote resources can be retrieved during the bullet graphic rendering process. This could allow malicious remote resources to be downloaded, which could potentially lead to code execution. An attacker may therefore be able to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine by tricking them into opening a crafted document containing malicious bullet graphic features.",
