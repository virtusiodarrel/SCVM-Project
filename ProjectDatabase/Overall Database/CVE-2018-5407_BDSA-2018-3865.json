    "title": "Linux Kernel Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Side-Channel Timing Attack Using Port Contention on SMT/Hyper-Threading Architectures",
    "description": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to information exposure due to a side-channel attack exploitable on CPUs using a simultaneous multithreading (SMT) architecture, such as Intel Hyper-Threading (HT). This could allow an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information using a malicious process running in parallel on the same physical core as the targeted process.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability was demonstrated on Intel Skylake/Kaby Lake processors by obtaining an OpenSSL P-384 private key from a TLS server.",
    "technicalDescription": "SMT architectures allow multiple threads of execution to run on a single CPU core. Such threads share access to the core's execution units via a set of ports; port contention occurs when instructions from multiple threads are issued to the same port, requiring the core scheduler to delay instructions to ensure fair distribution. This contention can be exploited by an attacker to infer a target process's port usage, by measuring the delay in execution of instructions for a malicious process running in parallel on the same core. Subsequent timing analysis can reveal the process's execution flow and thus obtain secret data, such as private cryptographic keys as demonstrated in the OpenSSL attack.",
