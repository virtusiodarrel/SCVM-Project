    "title": "devise-two-factor Vulnerable to Token Reuse via Insufficient One-Time-Password Expiration",
    "description": "devise-two-factor is vulnerable to token reuse due to an improperly implemented one-time password (OTP) expiration mechanism. An attacker that is able to obtain a valid one-time-password could potentially gain access to a victim's account by using that password during a particular time interval.\n\nIt should be noted that this vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for **CVE-2015-7225**.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `lib/devise_two_factor/models/two_factor_authenticatable.rb` contains code that is used by devise-two-factor to implement the `TwoFactorAuthenticatable` module, which is used to validate one-time passwords. One-time passwords should not be usable after they have been consumed. However, the logic implemented within the `TwoFactorAuthenticatable` module is flawed, such that one-time passwords will become valid again during the trailing interval (specified by the `otp.interval` variable) that exists during the configured drift period (specified by the `otp_allowed_drift` variable). An attacker that has obtained a victim's one-time password could potentially re-use that password in order to gain access to the victim's account.",
