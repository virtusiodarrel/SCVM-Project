    "title": "Shadowsocks-Libev Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Insecure Network Packet Handling",
    "description": "Shadowsocks-Libev contains a vulnerability in the way network packets are handled while stream ciphers are being used. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause information disclosure by sending crafted packets to the server.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists only when stream ciphers are being used for encryption/decryption. Stream ciphers only provide confidentiality. They do not provide authentication or integrity. An attacker can exploit this fact by sending crafted packets of sufficient length to the server (`ss-server`) which is listening for connections. The server will attempt to decrypt these packets and parse the content inside. After this, the server will make a connection with the given destination IP address or hostname which has been specified in the first packet received. The attacker could use this flaw to conduct fingerprinting and eventually reveal the application server as a Shadowsocks proxy server by using random connection requests and DNS lookups.\nFurthermore, if an attacker is able to complete a connection with the server (using random I.V values), he can encrypt and decrypt the network traffic. Also, the attacker knows the first request sent (which contains relevant connection information) and the initialization vector (I.V) value. So he can use all this information to conduct an offline bruteforcing attack to obtain the password or the base64 encoded key of the server.   \n\n**Note** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic using the man-in-the-middle attack.",
