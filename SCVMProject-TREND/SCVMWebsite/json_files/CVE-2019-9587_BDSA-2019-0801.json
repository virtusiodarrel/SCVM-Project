    "title": "Xpdf Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Recursion in 'Catalog::countPageTree()' Function",
    "description": "Xpdf is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a crafted PDF file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `Catalog::countPageTree()`, defined within `Catalog.cc`, counts the nodes within the page tree that is constructed whenever Xpdf is parsing an input file. This function calls itself recursively so that the child of each parent node is counted. The number of times that the function will be called is dependent on the value returned by the function `arrayGetLength()`. Each time the function called, an additional stack frame is created. If the value returned by `arrayGetLength()` is large enough, enough stack frames will be created to exhaust all available stack memory. Any attempt to construct additional stack frames will correspond to an illegitimate memory access operation, resulting in a segmentation fault. For certain input PDF files, the value returned by `arrayGetLength()` will be large enough to cause this event. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into such a file as input into Xpdf, which they have crafted specifically for this purpose.",
