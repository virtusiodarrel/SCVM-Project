    "description": "VLC Media Player is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted `.mp4` file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `MP4_EIA608_Convert()`, which is defined within the file `mp4.c`, contains code that dynamically manipulates memory using a variety of variables. The value of the variable `i_bytes` is used within a `while` loop in order to control the number of bytes that are written to the buffer `p_write`. The value of `i_bytes` is decreased via this loop until its value falls below a threshold, at which point the write operations cease. The code does not implement sufficient validation such that an underflow of `i_bytes` is possible. This could cause the value of `i_bytes` to become extremely large, which will in turn cause the function to write data beyond the boundaries of the `p_write` buffer. This buffer overflow could cause the application to attempt to write data to an invalid memory address, which will raise an exception and halt program execution, causing a DoS. \n\nSimilarly, the value of `i_remaining` is used to determine the quantity of memory that will be allocated for a memory buffer (denoted by `p_newblock`). The `block_Alloc()` function is used to allocate this memory, the quantity of which is calculated dynamically via subtracting from `i_remaining`. This provides another opportunity for an integer underflow to occur, which could lead to a much larger than intended quantity of memory being allocated. This unintended behavior could also end up halting the program's execution.\n\nAn attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted `.mp4` file as input, which has been crafted so as to trigger one (or both) of these underflow events.",
