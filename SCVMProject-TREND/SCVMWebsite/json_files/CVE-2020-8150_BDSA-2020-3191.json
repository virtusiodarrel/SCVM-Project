    "title": "Nextcloud Vulnerable to Encryption Downgrade Attack via Encrypt-then-MAC Encryption Scheme",
    "description": "Nextcloud is vulnerable to an encryption downgrade attack. This could allow an attacker to downgrade the encryption scheme of encrypted files, which could then allow them to use a known-plaintext attack in order to inject malicious content into the files which can be used to exploit a user accessing the files.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists when an attacker has access to encrypted files that have been encrypted using the newest Encrypt-than-MAC encryption scheme with `AES-256-CTR`. They can then strip the signature elements from the content block footers and change the cipher in the file header from `AES-256-CTR` to `AES-256-CFB`. This will give the attacker access to the first 16-bytes of the plaintext versions of the file. This allows the attacker to perform a known-plaintext attack in order to inject malicious content into the file. These injected binaries can then be used to  exploit a user who accesses the file.",
