    "title": "Node.js Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via Insecure TLS Session Caching",
    "description": "Node.js is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to the unsafe implementation of a TLS session caching mechanism. A remote attacker could monitor and manipulate TLS traffic to a vulnerable host by carrying out a maliciously crafted TLS negotiation with that host. The attacker requires a valid Certificate Authority signed certificate in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "technicalDescription": "Whenever a Node.js client opens multiple connections to the same server, it may reuse TLS session information.  Whenever a TLS session is resumed, the host name verification check will not be conducted, provided the host has presented a valid CA certificate. A TLS session can be cached following the triggering of the `session` event. This is intended to follow the `secureConnect` event, which verifies the peer that the client is connecting to. However, it is possible that the `session` event can be triggered before the `secureConnect` event completes, which can allow illegitimate server sessions to be cached. This is because the `session` event is triggered by the `get_session_cb()` function, which is evaluated regardless of the result of the `onConnectSecure()` procedure. The illegimate cached session can later be resumed, potentially connecting the host to a malicious, attacker controlled server. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS).",
