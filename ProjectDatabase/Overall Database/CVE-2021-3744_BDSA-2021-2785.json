    "description": "The Linux Kernel is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) issue due to the presence of a memory leak in the `ccp-ops` crypto driver.\n\nAn attacker could use this issue to cause excessive consumption of memory which could impact performance and stability.",
    "technicalDescription": "The Linux Kernel is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions because the `ccp-ops` cypto driver code in the `drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c` file contains multiple flaws that could lead to the occurrence of a memory leak.\n\nThere are 3 flaws present in the code:\n* A failure of the `ccp_init_data()` call is not sufficiently handled which can cause `aad` to not be freed.\n* The label used to free the final `&final_wa` is misnamed as `e_tag` where it should be `e_final_wa`.\n* On one error path, the `&tag` is leaked .",
