    "title": "Netty Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling via Insufficient Validation in 'Http2MultiplexHandler'",
    "description": "Netty contains a HTTP request smuggling vulnerability. This allows a remote attacker to craft HTTP requests that may be parsed incorrectly by applications using Netty. This can result in additional requests being made to internal services.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation by the `Http2MultiplexHandler`. If a `Content-Length` header exists in the original `HTTP/2` request, the `Http2MultiplexHandler` doesn't validate the request. If a request is received as an `HTTP/2` stream and the `http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` converts the request into the `HTTP/1.1` domain objects, an attacker may be able to smuggle additional requests inside the request if it is then sent to the child channel's pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as `HTTP/1.1`.\n\n**Note**: The original fix for **CVE-2021-21295**, made [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj), is incomplete and does not consider requests using a single `Http2HeaderFrame`. **CVE-2021-21409** covers this extra case and was reported [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-f256-j965-7f32).",
