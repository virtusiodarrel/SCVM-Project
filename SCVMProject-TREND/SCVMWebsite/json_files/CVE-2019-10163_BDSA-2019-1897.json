    "description": "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability has been discovered in PowerDNS Authoritative Server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a large number of notify request messages to a server to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\nNote that only servers configured as slaves are affected by this issue.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in PowerDNS Authoritative Server which can lead to an application crash. The `CommunicatorClass::mainloop` function located in the file `pdns/communicator.cc` does not implement validation protections against a large numbers of notify requests being sent to the slave server. It is possible for an authorized master server to flood slave servers with a large number of NOTIFY requests to consume CPU resources, preventing further updates to any slave server.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely via maliciously crafted requests to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
