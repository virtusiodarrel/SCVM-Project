    "title": "GPAC Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in 'stsz_box_read()' Function",
    "description": "GPAC is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) and denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on a victim's machine by tricking that victim into running the application with a maliciously crafted input file. It is also possible for an attacker to cause the application to crash.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `stsz_box_read()`, of file `src/isomedia/box_code_base.c`, defines the local variable `ptr`. This is a pointer to a `GF_SampleSizeBox` structure. This structure contains the member `sampleCount`, which is of type `u32` (i.e. an unsigned 32-bit integer). The value of `sampleCount` is obtained within `stsz_box_read()` by evaluating the `gf_bs_read_u32()` function. The function will attempt to validate the value of `sampleCount` by comparing it to the `size` member of `ptr`. However, `size` is of type `u64`. This faulty comparison operation means that the function can fail to detect invalid values of `sampleCount` (i.e. values that are too large).\n\nThe `ptr` structure also contains a member, `sizes`, which is a pointer to an array of `u32` values. The values that are stored in this array are derived from the bit stream, `bs`, that is being processed. This array is located on the heap, and is allocated via a call to `gf_malloc()`. The argument that is passed to `gf_malloc()`, which corresponds to the size of the array that needs to be allocated, is obtained by calculating `ptr->sampleCount * sizeof(u32)`.\n\nIf `sampleCount` is too large, then an integer overflow can occur whenever this calculation is performed. This will mean that the value that is passed to `gf_malloc()` will be too small. This in turn will mean that the `sizes` buffer will not be large enough to store all of the values that are retrieved from the bit stream. A heap buffer overflow will therefore occur whenever the `for` loop that populates the array is evaluated. This can lead to an exception being raised, which will cause the program to crash. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the application with a maliciously crafted input file. It may also be possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, but this has not been demonstrated.",
