    "description": "BigBlueButton is vulnerable to information exposure via path traversal. This could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files and gain improper access to video chat rooms by supplying a specially crafted URL.",
    "technicalDescription": "An upload function was found to lack proper file checks and so permits the upload of various file formats. It was determined that these files can be integrated in to an Office file via URLs. These can either be standard URLs or pointers to files on the local system. Successful exploitation can grant access to configuration files such as those that contain API keys. This could allow an attacker to dial in to closed sessions without authorization, or to gain control of rooms belonging to others.",
