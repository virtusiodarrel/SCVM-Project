    "description": "Redis is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) issue due to the presence of an integer overflow flaw with the `COPY` command when the default `set-max-intset-entries` configuration value has been altered.\n\nAn attacker could execute the `COPY` command with a large set key and trigger the integer overflow in order to corrupt the memory heap and potentially execute code.",
    "technicalDescription": "Redis is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) because the `COPY` command can cause an integer overflow and heap corruption to occur when used to duplicate a large set key that consists of integer values. To create a large set key, the default `set-max-intset-entries` configuration value must be changed.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated [here](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-qh52-crrg-44g3) that the integer overflow bug exists in all versions of Redis starting with **2.6**, where it could result with a corrupted `RDB` or `DUMP` payload, but not exploited through `COPY`. While Redis **6.0** and earlier are not directly affected  by this issue, the vendor recommends that they should be upgraded as they are potentially vulnerable to other issues due to lack of `RDB` and `RESTORE` payload sanitization, which was introduced in **6.2.0**.",
