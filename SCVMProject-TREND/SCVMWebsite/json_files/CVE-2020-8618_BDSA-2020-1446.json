    "title": "Bind Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Reachable Assertion During Zone Transfer",
    "description": "Bind is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to a reachable assertion failure condition. An attacker with the ability to send zone data to a vulnerable server in response to a zone transfer request, could cause that server to crash by including maliciously crafted data within that response.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `rdataset.c` contains multiple functions for operating on DNS records that have been received by the server, such as via a zone transfer. These functions perform low-level operations on data in memory. Some checks are performed during processing of the records in order to try and prevent memory corruption from taking place. One of these checks is intended to prevent an out-of-bounds memory access, and will trigger an assertion if such an access occurs. \n\nAn out-of-bounds memory access can be triggered by causing the application to process a very large DNS dataset, which will trigger the assertion and cause the server to crash. A remote attacker who is able to send zone transfer data to a vulnerable server could therefore exploit this to cause a DoS.",
