    "title": "Tendermint Core Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via 'DuplicateVoteEvidence' Object",
    "description": "Tendermint Core contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to improper handling of double signing misbehavior. Successfully exploiting this could allow an attacker to cause the application to disconnect from nodes with invalid data.",
    "technicalDescription": "When double signs occur in Tendermint Core, then a `DuplicateVoteEvidence` object will be formed by the `consensus` reactor. However, this occurs when the formation of the block is still in progress, which could allow for different nodes in a network block having differing last commits when assigning a timestamp to a `DuplicateVoteEvidence` instance. This will lead to different nodes having different timestamps, but with similar `DuplicateVoteEvidence` objects. Eventually one `DuplicateVoteEvidence` object with one associated timestamp will get finalized in the block, meaning any `DuplicateVoteEvidence` objects which are different will be considered invalid. Any node which has a invalid `DuplicateVoteEvidence` object will then propose invalid evidence which will cause it to be disconnected. \n\nThe vendor has mitigated against this by ensuring the `DuplicateVoteEvidence` is no longer formed by the `consensus` reactor, but instead by the `EvidencePool`. This change means that there will be one consistent timestamp across nodes in a network block.",
