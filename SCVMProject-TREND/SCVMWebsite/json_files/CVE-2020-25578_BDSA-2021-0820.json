    "description": "FreeBSD is vulnerable to a stack leak vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this to leak sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue is due to how the `dirent` structure exports file system directory entries to userspace. `VOP_READDIR` is used to convert from the file system's layout into a generic form. Due to the `d_off` field not being properly initialized when the `dirent` structures are returned by `VOP_READER`, eight bytes of uninitialized kernel stack memory are leaked into userspace.\n\nSpecifically the `tmpfs`, `smbfs`, `autofs` and `mqueuefs`  were failing to properly initialize this memory. Also, `msdosfs` leaks three bytes due to failing to zero-fill two padding fields.\n\nThe vendor states that the sensitive information obtained from exploiting this vulnerability could be used to compromise the system.",
