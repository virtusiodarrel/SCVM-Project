    "title": "Vaadin Flow Vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Missing Quote Character Sanitization in Development Mode Handler",
    "description": "Vaadin Flow is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the improper URL sanitation by the frontend development server. It is possible to gain access to a locally running Vaadin application in the browser by executing cross-site scripting from an external web page that is opened by the targeted developer.",
    "technicalDescription": "Successful exploitation requires that Vaadin is running with the frontend development server started and that the targeted developer opens an external site that executes the malicious script. This vulnerability is caused by the `\"` character in URLs not being properly passed to the development server and can only be exploited in development environment (deployed applications are safe).",
