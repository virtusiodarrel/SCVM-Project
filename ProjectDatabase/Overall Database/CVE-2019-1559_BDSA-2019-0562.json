    "description": "An information exposure vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by capturing and sending ciphertexts to understand cryptography patterns, which could lead to the ability decrypt sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in OpenSSL which could expose sensitive information. If the application encounters a fatal protocol error the `SSL_shutdown()` method is called twice, first to send a `close_notify` and the second to receive one. OpenSSL can respond differently to these application calls for a 0 byte record which contain invalid padding compared with a 0 byte record which contains an invalid message authentication code (MAC).\n\nThis process is handled in the `ssl3_send_alert` function located in the file ` ssl/s3_pkt`.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending different formed ciphertexts to evaluate how the application responds. This could lead to understanding the cryptography patterns, which can be utilized to determine the algorithm, providing the ability to decrypt sensitive data.",
