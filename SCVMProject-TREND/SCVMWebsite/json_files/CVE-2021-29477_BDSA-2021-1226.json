    "description": "Redis is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the presence of an integer overflow flaw in the `STRALGO LCS` command.\n\nAn attacker could execute the `STRALGO LCS` command with crafted input and trigger the integer overflow in order to corrupt heap memory and potentially execute code.",
    "technicalDescription": "Redis is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) because the `STRALGO LCS` command contains an integer overflow issue due to insufficient input validation. The affected code can be found in the `stralgoLCS()` function, of file `src/t_string.c`.\n\nThis vulnerability was first reported as **CVE-2021-29477**, but has also been assigned **CVE-2021-32625** due to incomplete fixes - only 64-bit systems were initially fixed. To address this, the vendor has released a new fix that patches the vulnerability on 32-bit systems as well.",
