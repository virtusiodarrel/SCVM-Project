    "title": "Python Requests Vulnerable Information Disclosure via Man-in-the-Middle Attack during HTTP Redirect",
    "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability has been discovered in Python Requests. A HTTP authorization header is sent to a non-SSL URI after receiving  a HTTP to HTTPS redirect. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) procedure to sniff the network and discover sensitive information such as account credentials.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `SessionRedirectMixin` class located in the file `requests/sessions.py` incorrectly parses authentication headers during redirect requests. The `resolve_redirects` is utilizing an IF statement with invalid conditions which allows authentication headers to be submitted. The process results in headers only being stripped if the hostname changed which allows a same host redirect from SSL to non-SSL to include the headers.  This would allow the headers to be exposed via network sniffing. \n\nA function called `should_strip_auth` has been implemented to handle this weakness. It will determine if the authentication headers need to be removed from a request based on which ports are used. A request switch from `HTTPS` TO `HTTP` will only contain headers if the port is white listed.",
