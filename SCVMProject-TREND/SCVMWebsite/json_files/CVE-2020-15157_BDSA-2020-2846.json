    "description": "containerd is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure. An attacker can use this in order to obtain another users credentials, either their username and password for the registry, or their  credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance of containerd.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists If a container image manifest includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer. When a user pulls that image the default containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it, and while doing this provide its authentication credentials. An attacker can take advantage of this by publishing a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server, and tricking a user into pulling that image. This could allow the attacker to obtain another users credentials, either their username and password for the registry, or their credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance of containerd.",
