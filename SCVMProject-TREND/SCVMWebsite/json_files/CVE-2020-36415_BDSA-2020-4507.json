    "description": "CMS Made Simple is vulnerable to a self cross-site scripting (self-XSS) issue due to a lack of sufficient input sanitization in the `Design Manager` functionality.\n\nAn attacker could trick an administrative user into copying and pasting malicious content into the `Name` field found in the `Layout`/`Stylesheets`/`Create a new Stylesheet` feature in order to steal the victim administrative user's session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated in a comment on the issue report [here](http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/bug/view/12325), that this issue will not be fixed as it \"affects only submitting user.\" In this case, the `Name` field is not stored. According to the [Report a Vulnerability](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/community/get-involved/report-a-vulnerability) page, the vendor does not consider \"the ability to include scripts in any field in the backend, or the uploading of certain file types via the File Manager, to be legitimate vulnerabilities.\"",
    "technicalDescription": "CMS Made Simple is vulnerable to self cross-site scripting (self-XSS) because the `Name` field that is used to define a new 'Stylesheet' is not sufficiently sanitized. This field is accessible by administrative users within the `Design Manager`  functionality.\n\nA malicious script inserted in this field can be triggered against the submitting user upon selecting the `Submit` option and viewing the preview of the 'Stylesheet'.",
