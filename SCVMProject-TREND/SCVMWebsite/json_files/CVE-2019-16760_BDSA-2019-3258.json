    "title": "Rust Vulnerable to Malicious Dependency Download via Cargo Package Manager 'Package' Config Key",
    "description": "Rust's Cargo package manager can download the wrong dependencies due to an oversight in the `package.toml` parsing code.  If the `[Package]` configuration key is used to rename packages, Rust will ignore the renamed package.  This can result in the wrong packages being downloaded from `crates.io`.  This may be exploited by a remote attacker squatting a valid Rust crate.",
    "technicalDescription": "Rust's package manager Cargo can be configured through `cargo.toml` and the `[dependency]` config key to depend on crates.  The issue is with Cargo's `[package]` configuration key implementation which was introduced so that developers could rename packages.  This feature was introduced in version **1.26.0** of Rust.  Since earlier versions do not support this feature, the `[package]` key is ignored.  This means a malicious actor could squat a package name causing early versions of Rust to download malicious packages.  This also affects dependencies that depend on other crates.  So hypothetically, a victim using versions of Rust prior to **1.26.0** only needs to use a crate which is depending on a malicious crate.",
