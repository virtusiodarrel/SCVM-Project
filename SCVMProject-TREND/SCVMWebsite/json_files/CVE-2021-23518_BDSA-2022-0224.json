    "title": "cached-path-relative Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via 'cache' Variable in Function 'cachedPathRelative'",
    "description": "cached-path-relative npm package contains a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `cachedPathRelative` function. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious properties into prototypes, which will then be inherited by all objects in that prototype chain. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) and arbitrary code execution.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability exists due to the improperly initialized `cache` variable in the `cachedPathRelative` function. It was fixed by changing the initialization from `{}` to `Object.create(null)`.\n\n**Note:** the prototype pollution via improper `cache` initialization was first noted in `CVE-2018-16472`. It was initially fixed in **1.0.2** by [this](https://github.com/ashaffer/cached-path-relative/commit/a43cffec84ed0e9eceecb43b534b6937a8028fc0) commit. However, the same flaw was also found in `cachedPathRelative` function, which resulted in this vulnerability ( `CVE-2021-23518`).",
