    "title": "Apache Airflow Vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'Origin' Parameter",
    "description": "Apache Airflow is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this in order to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser, possibly leading to session cookie disclosure and other impacts.\n\n**Note** This issue occurs as a result of an incomplete fix for **CVE-2020-13944** (**BDSA-2020-2409**). The issue was not properly fixed and required an additional disclosure as **CVE-2021-28359** (**BDSA-2021-1214**).",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `airflow/www/views.py` and `airflow/www_rbac/views.py` files. It was mitigated by further sanitizing the values passed to the `origin` parameter through the implementation of `parse_qsl` and `urlencode`.\n\nThis was thought to have been fixed in **1.10.13rc1** by [this](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/9818932bee64bd5b0bb7433b8154b2b8d0b3feb4) commit, however it was later discovered this was an incomplete fix.",
