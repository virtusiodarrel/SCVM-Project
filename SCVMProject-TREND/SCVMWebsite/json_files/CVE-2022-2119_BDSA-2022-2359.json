    "title": "OFFIS DCMTK Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Path Traversal in Service Class Provider (SCP)",
    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability has been discovered in OFFIS DCMTK's service class provider (SCP). An attacker with adjacent network access could exploit this in order to gain the ability to write DICOM files into arbitrary directories under controlled names. This could potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE).",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue was mitigated by ensuring that the filename is sanitized as opposed to the path name. All path separators are now replaced with underscores so a to avoid path traversal if malformed data is read from a file name or as part of a file.",
