    "title": "Curl Vulnerable to Credential Leak via 'Same Host Check' Functionality",
    "description": "Curl contains a credential leak vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this issue by utilizing cross-protocol redirects and/or separate port numbers to leak sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.",
    "technicalDescription": "Curl has a \"same host check\" feature, which passes credentials on to the same hostname. Due to a flaw in this functionality, some ports and cross-protocol redirects are not considered to be of a separate hostname, therefore allowing for the unintentional sharing of credentials from auth-protected HTTPS URLs and ports to an external server. As well as Curl credentials, TLS SRP user credentials are also leaked on redirects, `CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME` and `CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD`.\n\nThis was mitigated by introducing a check to clear authentication if a redirect to a different hostname or port is requested.",
