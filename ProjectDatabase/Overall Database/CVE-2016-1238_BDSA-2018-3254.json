    "description": "SpamAssassin has a flaw in one configuration script that is caused by a reliance on the `.` in `@INC`. It is possible that this could be exploited by an attacker although the method of attack is uncertain.",
    "technicalDescription": "Apache SpamAssassin is written in Perl. The array `@INC` contains the list of places that the `do EXPR` , `require`, or `use` constructs look for their library files. It initially consists of the arguments to any `-I` command-line switches, followed by the default Perl library, probably `/usr/local/lib/perl`, followed by `.`, to represent the current directory.\n\nSpamAssassin has a flaw in file `spamc/configure.pl` that is caused by a reliance on the `.` in `@INC`. The script assumes that `.` (signifying the current working directory) is in the array `@INC` when it may have been removed for security reasons. \n\nIt is possible that this could be exploited by an attacker although the method of attack is uncertain.",
