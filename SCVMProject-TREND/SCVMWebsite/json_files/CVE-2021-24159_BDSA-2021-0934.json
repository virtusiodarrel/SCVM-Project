    "description": "Contact Form 7 Style, the addon for Contact Form 7, is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue due a lack of sufficient input sanitization and nonce protection in the 'custom CSS' functionality.\n\nAn attacker could attempt to trick an administrative user into clicking on a crafted link in order to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack to alter the CSS settings and inject a malicious script.",
    "technicalDescription": "Contact Form 7 Style is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) because the 'custom CSS' functionality does not sufficiently protect against administrative users inserting malicious scripts. A lack of nonce protection on this feature also allows for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks to potentially succeed.\n\nAn XSS attack using this attack vector requires the attacker to have administrative privileges, or at least be able to trick an administrative user into following a crafted link to perform a CSRF attack and inject malicious scripts using the 'custom CSS' feature.\n\n**Note**: Due to security issues present in Contact Form 7 Style, the [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-style/) is no longer available as of **2021-02-01** and as such, has not received a fix for this issue.",
