    "description": "Prism is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper validation of user-supplied input. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal sensitive information such as authentication scripts and user session cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The issue exists within the file `plugins/previewers/prism-previewers.js`. The Previewers plugin on versions >=**v1.10.0**, and the Previewer: Easing plugin on versions **v1.1.0** to **v1.9.0**, do not sanitize `location.href` values which are set in inner HTML. This could allow maliciously crafted JavaScript to be executed on a victim's system when they use the easing preview on targeted code blocks.",
