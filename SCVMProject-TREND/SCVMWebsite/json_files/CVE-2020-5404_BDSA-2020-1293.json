    "title": "Reactor Netty Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Credentials Leak during 'HttpClient' Redirection Process",
    "description": "Reactor Netty is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the possible leaking of credentials during web request redirection. A remote attacker could obtain a victim's credentials by tricking them into making a web request that will trigger a redirect event.  \n\nThe `HttpClient` component must be configured to follow redirects in order for the instance of Reactor Netty to be vulnerable.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `HttpClient` class within Reactor Netty contains the `followRedirect()` method, which is invoked whenever a HTTP request is redirected to another domain. The redirection process is not handled safely such that the client's credentials, such as session tokens, may be exposed in the request that is sent to the redirection domain. A remote attacker could therefore obtain sensitive information if they are able to trick a victim into submitting a request that will be redirected to a domain that the attacker controls.",
