    "description": "Sentrifugo was found to be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via bypass of uploading restrictions. Maliciously crafted PHP files could result in arbitrary code execution.",
    "technicalDescription": "It was discovered that the bypass of file restrictions is possible via uploading of `.php` files with a valid extension such as `.doc` appended. Once a file has been selected the file name can be altered within the upload request so that the `.php` file is uploaded. The content type can also be changed to `application/x-httpd-php`. After the file has been successfully uploaded it can then be used to execute commands on the machine through use of a malicious webshell. \n\nThe affected files are `/sentrifugo/index.php/mydetails/documents` and `sentrifugo/index.php/policydocuments/add` with the latter requiring advanced permissions to access.",
