    "title": "set-in Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via Insufficient Input Validation in 'setIn' Method",
    "description": "set-in is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to insufficient validation being performed in its `setIn()` method. An attacker that is able to control the input to this method could leverage this issue in order to modify the prototypes of objects in memory. The exact impact that the attacker can achieve will depend on how the object is used, but could potentially include denial-of-service (DoS) and remote code execution (RCE).\n\nNote: This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for **CVE-2020-28273** (**BDSA-2020-4631**).",
    "technicalDescription": "The `setIn()` method, of file `index.js`, has three parameters (`object`, `path` and `value`). The `recursivelySetIn()` method is invoked by `setIn()` in order to modify the properties of `object`. The properties which are to be modified are derived from the value of `path`, with their new values being set using the `value` parameter. Insufficient validation is performed on the value of `path`, which could allow an attacker to modify the values of the `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype` properties. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to conduct a prototype pollution attack. The exact impact that the attacker can achieve will depend on how the object is used, but could potentially include denial-of-service (DoS) and remote code execution (RCE).",
