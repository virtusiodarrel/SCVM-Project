    "title": "Linux Kernel Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Out-of-bounds Write in 'vhost_net' Driver",
    "description": "Linux kernel is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to insufficient limitation of input passed to a vhost_net driver function which can result in an out-of-bounds write. A malicious virtual guest can trigger an arbitrary write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host to cause kernel memory corruption and system panic. This can also lead to privilege escalation, however it is thought to be an unlikely scenario as the attacker is not able to control what is written into memory.",
    "technicalDescription": "The problem was introduced along with the addition of \"batch used ring updating\" meant to deal with fast guests. Since then the heads are batched in `vq->heads` for more than one packet. The issue is that the amount of batched heads passed to `get_rx_bufs()` is not properly limited which may lead to an out-of-bounds write. This could allow an attacker to write 8 to 504 bytes of data to arbitrary memory regions, however the content of the data cannot be directly controlled.",
