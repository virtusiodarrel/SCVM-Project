    "title": "Bind Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service via Reachable Assertion During Non-Terminal Entry Parsing",
    "description": "Bind is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to a reachable failure condition. A remote attacker who is able to manipulate zone content could cause a vulnerable server to crash by introducing a maliciously crafted record.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `rbtdb.c` contains code that is used during the parsing of nodes that are present in a DNS zone file. Nodes in the DNS graph can be terminal (no other nodes exist beyond it), or non-terminal (the node exists between other nodes). The asterisk character is commonly used as a wildcard character within terminal nodes. However, if an asterisk character is found within an empty non-terminal location on the DNS graph, then the application can enter into an inconsistent state. This will lead to an assertion failure within the code of `rbtdb.c`, causing the application to crash. An attacker who is able to change zone DNS records could therefore cause a DoS by crafting a malicious record that contains an asterisk in an empty non-terminal node.",
