    "title": "Backdrop Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Menu Links",
    "description": "Backdrop content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient sanitization of client-provided input. A remote authenticated attacker could execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by crafting malicious administrative menu links. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `buildResultsList()`, of file `admin_bar.js`, is used by Backdrop CMS in order to dynamically generate HTML `li` elements which display the results of a user's search. Each search result, denoted by the `result ` variable, is inserted into the `li` element without being sanitized. If an attacker is able to create an administrative menu link that constitutes a XSS payload, then that payload can be executed in the browser of a user when they perform a search. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
