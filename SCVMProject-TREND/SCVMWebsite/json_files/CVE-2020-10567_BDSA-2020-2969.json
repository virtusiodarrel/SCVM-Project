    "description": "ResponsiveFileManager is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) issue due to how the `save_img` action does not sufficiently validate the extension of the uploaded file.\n\nAn attacker could upload a crafted image file containing executable PHP code and use this issue to execute malicious code on the server.",
    "technicalDescription": "ResponsiveFileManager is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) because the `save_img` action in the `ajax_calls.php` file does not sufficiently validate the extension of the uploaded file. The existing check validates if the file is a valid base64 encoded image. This check can be bypassed by uploading a valid JPEG image containing a PHP tag inside of the EXIF data.\n\nOnce uploaded, an attacker can request the uploaded file to execute the code included in the file.",
