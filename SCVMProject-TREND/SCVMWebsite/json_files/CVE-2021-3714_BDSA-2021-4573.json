    "title": "Linux Kernel Vulnerable to Remote Information Disclosure via Side Channel Leak with Memory De-Duplication Attacks",
    "description": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to memory de-duplication attacks. A remote attacker able to control page sized file creation on a Linux server and can determine the access time change of the files can leak sensitive kernel memory.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to disclose memory contents from a remote server via sending and timing **HTTP/1** and **HTTP/2** network requests. \nPer the attached exploit an attacker may be able to disclose the presence of data in memory on a server running Memcached. This disclosure may also be utilized for fingerprinting and detection of the libc version, over the internet. Furthermore, when paired with InnoDB leakage of MariaDB database records could potentially be possible. Additionally, as demonstrated in the exploit, a fully remote KASLR break was achieved which subsequently allowed derandomization of the kernel image of a virtual machine over the Internet.",

    "workaround": "The following mitigations have been proposed. They potentially have significant impact on system performance and stability so should be carefully tested prior to deployment:\n\n> - Deactivation of memory de-duplication\n> \n> Deactivating memory de-duplication will effectively mitigate all attack vectors. This measure unfortunately eliminates all the highly appreciated benefits of memory de-duplication, namely the increase of operational cost-effectiveness through inter-VM memory sharing. This will cause an increase in the amount of memory required and in some situations may adversely impact performance (e.g. due to slower swap space being used). It is recommended that customers test this workaround before using it in production.\n> \n> - Disabling services and firewall rules.\n> \n> The attack uses the response time of services on the system. By limiting access to services an attacker must connect to the service to successful carry out the exploit. Reducing the number of systems that are allowed to connect to the service will prevent an attack from working when launched outside an allowed ranges. While this does not prevent an attack from working, it will reduce the amount of systems that an attacker can launch an attack from.",
