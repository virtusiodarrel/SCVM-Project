    "title": "Systemd Allows Denial-of-Service (DoS) of Privileged Processes via Incorrect MAINPID and PIDFile Handling",
    "description": "Systemd may allow a local attacker to use an unprivileged account to kill privileged processes running on the system, resulting in denial-of-service (DoS). An attacker who is able to write to the `PIDFile` of a service started by an unprivileged user may trick systemd into killing other processes, including privileged ones.",
    "technicalDescription": "`PIDFiles` hold the `PID` of the running daemon, so it can be stopped, restarted, or signaled at a later time. Systemd also uses this file to retrieve the `PID` of the main process of a service. The problem is that lack of a check placed on the `PIDFile` may be abused by modifying its content (given sufficient permissions) in order to make systemd kill the wrong process. After writing an arbitrary `PID` into the file, systemd will kill that process even if it is owned by another service whenever the service the `PIDFile` belongs to is stopped. Since systemd kills processes with root permissions this can also lead to a complete system shutdown.",
