    "title": "Nextcloud Server Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Federated File Share",
    "description": "Nextcloud Server contains a privilege escalation vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain read and write privileges on any federated file share. Public links can also be added as a federated file share, therefore this vulnerability can also be exploited on any public link.\n\n**Note**: The issue reporter has stated [here](https://hackerone.com/reports/1170024#activity-11480951) that this vulnerability could be exploited in combination with **CVE-2021-32655** (**BDSA-2021-1766**) to first convert File Drop links to a federated share and then `Write` privileges.",
    "technicalDescription": "An attacker in possession of a share link could use the 'Add to my Nextcloud' functionality to add a federated share to their own Nextcloud instance. This allows the attacker to then submit a crafted request to the victim Nextcloud instance containing a `remote id` and `token` found in the `oc_share_external` table. The attacker is then granted `Read`, `Write`, `Update`, `Create` and `Share` access on the federated share.",
