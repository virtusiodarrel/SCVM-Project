    "title": "Nextcloud Server Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via 'File Drop' to Federated Share Flaw",
    "description": "Nextcloud Server is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue in the 'File Drop' functionality due to a lack of sufficient validation for 'Add to your Nextcloud' requests.\n\nAn attacker with knowledge of a 'File Drop' link could abuse this flaw could attempt convert the link to a federated share with a crafted request where a victim user may inadvertently allow them to read files from the shared folder.\n\n**Note**: The issue reporter has stated [here](https://hackerone.com/reports/1167929#activity-11480965) that this vulnerability could be exploited in combination with **CVE-2021-32654** (**BDSA-2021-1704**) to compromise all File Drop shares and gain `Write` privileges.",
    "technicalDescription": "Nextcloud Server is vulnerable to privilege escalation because the 'File Drop' functionality does not prevent users from sharing the file upload folder with their own Nextcloud.\n\nAn attacker in possession of a valid 'File Drop' link could submit a crafted federated share request that will appear in the UI of the sharing 'File Drop' user. If this user tries to remove the `Create` privileges from the unexpected share, Nextcloud silently grants the share `Read` privileges which allows the attacker to read arbitrary files from the shared folder.",
