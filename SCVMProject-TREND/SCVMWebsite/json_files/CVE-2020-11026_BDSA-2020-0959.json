    "title": "WordPress Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via File Uploads in Media Component",
    "description": "WordPress is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the Media component. This could allow an authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal sensitive information such as authentication tokens and user session cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The issue exists in the function `sanitize_file_name()` within the file `src/wp-includes/formatting.php`. The filter does not properly sanitize Unicode characters in filenames for uploads to the Media component. An attacker with sufficient privileges to perform uploads could exploit this by uploading a file with a maliciously crafted filename. If accessed by a victim, any included web scripts may be executed.",
