    "title": "ZoneMinder Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'filter[Name]' Request Parameter",
    "description": "ZoneMinder is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient sanitization of client-provided input. A remote attacker could execute malicious JavaScript within the browser of a victim by tricking that victim into clicking on a maliciously crafted link. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `filter.php` contains code that is used by ZoneMinder to apply search filters. A user can filter based on a name, which is sent to the server via the `filter[Name]` HTTP GET request parameter. The value of this parameter is extracted by the server and inserted into the response web page via the `echo()` function. The value will be inserted into the response as-is, with no validation or sanitization being performed. If the value of `filter[Name]` is a XSS payload, then this payload will be executed by the browser of the client. A remote attacker could therefore execute a XSS payload in the browser of a victim by tricking that victim into clicking on a maliciously crafted link. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
