    "title": "NetHack Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Buffer Overflow in SYMBOL Configuration FIle",
    "description": "NetHack contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application. It has been reported that privilege escalation and remote code execution (RCE) could potentially be achieved, but this has not been proven.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists when reading very long lines from a NetHack SYMBOL configuration file. An attacker who is able to upload their own configuration file can exploit this in order to cause a buffer overflow, which could lead to an exception being raised. This could allow an attacker to cause a DoS via an application crash. It has been reported that privilege escalation and remote code execution are possible outcomes, but these have not been demonstrated.",
