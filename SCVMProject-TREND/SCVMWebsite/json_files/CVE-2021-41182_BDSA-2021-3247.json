    "title": "jQuery-UI Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe 'altField' Option Handling",
    "description": "jQuery-UI is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the unsafe handling of options in the `Datepicker` widget. A remote attacker could execute malicious scripts in the browser of a victim by tricking the victim into opening maliciously crafted content. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies. It should be noted that this vulnerability can only be exploited in scenarios where the value of the `altField` option is derived from untrusted input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `Datepicker` widget is implemented using code from the file `ui/widgets/datepicker.js`. This widget can utilize the `altField` option, which is used to dynamically generate web page content. If the value of the `altField` option is derived from untrusted input, then an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into web content that is generated via the `Datepicker` widget. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
