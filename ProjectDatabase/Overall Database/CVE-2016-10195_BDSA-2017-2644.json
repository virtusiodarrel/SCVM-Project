    "title": "libevent Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Malformed DNS Query or Response",
    "description": "libevent is vulnerable to information disclosure due to a buffer overread issue in the  `name_parse()` function of libevent's DNS code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a system with maliciously crafted requests.",
    "technicalDescription": "libevent provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts. libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop. libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, zero-copy file transmission, and IOCP. libevent includes support for several useful protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and a minimal RPC framework. libevent is used commonly in Mozilla products.\n\nSeaMonkey is an Internet suite offering a built in webbrowser, mail and other functionality. It is the continuation of the former Mozilla Application Suite, based on the same source code, which originated from Netscape Communicator and was the base for Netscape 6 and Netscape 7. Compared to Firefox, the SeaMonkey web browser keeps the far more traditional-looking interface of Netscape and the Mozilla Suite. Many Firefox and Thunderbird add-ons can be modified for compatiblity with SeaMonkey.\n* Firefox is a web browser, originally based on components that formed SeaMonkey.\n* Firefox Mobile is an Android-based browser, developed from the desktop Firefox webbrowser.\n* Thunderbird is a mail client, originally based on components that formed SeaMonkey.\n* Gecko is the HTML rendering engine used by Seamonkey, Firefox and Thunderbird.\n\nAffected code where insufficient boundary checks exist:\n```\n971         if (cp != name_out) {\n972             if (cp + 1 >= end) return -1;\n973             *cp++ = '.';\n974         }\n975         if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;\n976         memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);\n977         cp += label_len;\n978         j += label_len;\n```",
