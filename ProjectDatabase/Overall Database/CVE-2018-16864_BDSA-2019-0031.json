    "title": "Systemd Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Arbitrary Code Execution via Attacker-Controlled 'alloca()' in 'journald'",
    "description": "Systemd is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to a flaw in the journald service which allows an attacker to allocate memory without limits. This can be exploited by passing several MB of arguments to a program calling the syslog function in order to cause a stack clash and a crash. This crash has been shown to be exploitable in some conditions and may allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying host.",
    "technicalDescription": "This flaw can be exploited via the `dispatch_message_real()` function of the `/journal/journald-server.c` source file. The function prepares a record for the journal by converting each field to a string using the `strjoina()` function. The resulting strings will be allocated on the stack using the `alloca()` function. Since the input is attacker-controllable, this can be abused by supplying several megabytes of command-line arguments to a program that calls `syslog()` in order to clash the stack with another memory region. This will overwrite that region's data as a result and cause a crash.\n\nIt has been shown that this crash can be leveraged to gain control over the eip register on i386 processors - a precursor to arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe initial flaw has been introduced in **v203** in [this](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/ae018d9bc900d6355dea4af05119b49c67945184) commit and became exploitable in **v230** from [this](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/ac2e41f5103ce2c679089c4f8fb6be61d7caec07) commit onwards.\n\nThis attack is not possible if systemd has been compiled with the `-fstack-clash-protection` flag.",
