    "title": "Eramba Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Attachments",
    "description": "It was discovered that Eramba is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient sanitization of user supplied input. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file with a malicious script as the filename. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of a user, potentially leading to the theft of session tokens, cookies and other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "The issue was fixed by sanitizing output on attachments. The patch has been released in version **2.19.3** of the enterprise edition. The community edition will receive this patch in the annual upgrade, which will take place around November.",
