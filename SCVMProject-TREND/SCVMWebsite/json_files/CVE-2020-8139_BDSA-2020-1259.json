    "title": "Nextcloud Vulnerable to Improper Access Control on Hide Download Functionality",
    "description": "Nextcloud functionality to hide the download option on a shared file, secure view or hide download, does not prevent a user from downloading that file due to improper access control. This could allow an attacker to download a shared file which was not intended by the owner of the shared file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The secure view or hide download feature intended to prevent a shared file from being downloaded can be bypassed by adding `/download` to the URL. There were no checks in `apps/files_sharing/lib/Controller/ShareController.php` to prevent the download of a shared file.",
