    "title": "Brave Desktop Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via CNAME Adblocking Feature",
    "description": "Brave Desktop is vulnerable to information disclosure via the `CNAME` adblocking feature as the system DNS settings were used instead of the extension's proxy settings. An attacker could exploit this in order to view DNS information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `UseCnameResult()` and `OnBeforeURLRequestAdBlockTP()` functions of the `browser/net/brave_ad_block_tp_network_delegate_helper.cc` file due to `CNAME` uncloaking if a proxy had been set. It was mitigated by switching to using the `ProxyConfigService` approach, and by splitting existing checks in to separate functions. Extra logging capabilities were also added to help with debugging of Windows issues, while `CONFIG_PENDING` fallback and associated logging was removed.",
