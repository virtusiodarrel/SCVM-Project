    "description": "Helm contains an unsanitized data vulnerability. An attacker could take advantage of this in order to display malicious information on a users terminal screen, as well as hide or change information on the terminal screen.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists due to Helm improperly sanitizing data from potentially untrusted sources. Places where this vulnerability is present include:\n* In the `version` field of a chart, if a `SemVer` is invalid the string is not sanitized\n* Some fields in the Helm repository `index.yaml` files are not properly sanitized\n* Some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins are not properly sanitized\n* Some fields in the `Chart.yaml` file are not properly sanitized\n\nIf a user is running the `helm` command on a terminal screen an attacker can take advantage of these unsanitized in inputs in order to display malicious information on a users terminal screen, as well as hide or change information on the terminal screen.",
