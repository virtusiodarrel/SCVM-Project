    "description": "Umbraco Content Management System (CMS) contains an open redirect vulnerability. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to trick a victim into being redirected to a malicious site using a crafted URL.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `src/Umbraco.Web.UI/config/splashes/booting.aspx` file due to insufficient sanitization of URL's. It was mitigated by the addition of a URL filter that only permits local URL's.",

This file is not often in active use and is therefore safe to remove for most people. Please note that your deployment strategy might include a NuGet restore which will restore booting.aspx on each deploy, make sure to take steps to prevent this file from being deployed.\"",
