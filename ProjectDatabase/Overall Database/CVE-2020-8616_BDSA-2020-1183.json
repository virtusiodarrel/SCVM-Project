    "title": "Bind Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Excessive Resource Consumption in Referrals Processing",
    "description": "It was discovered that BIND contains a resource consumption vulnerability. Due to insufficient limitations of the number of fetches performed when processing referral responses. An attacker could exploit this flaw to degrade server performance leading to a Denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The attacker could also leverage this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient limitation of the number of fetches performed when processing a referral response. An attacker could exploit this flaw using specially crafted referrals to cause a recursing sever to perform an excessive number of fetches when processing the referral response resulting in performance degradation potentially leading to a DoS condition. \n\nAn attacker could also exploit this flaw by using the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with an amplification factor of more than 1620x the number of packets exchanged by the recursive resolve resulting in excessive resource consumption creating a DoS.",
