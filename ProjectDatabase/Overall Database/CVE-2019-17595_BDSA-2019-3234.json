    "title": "NCurses Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Memory Corruption in 'fmt_entry()' Function",
    "description": "NCurses is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `fmt_entry()`, which is defined within the script `dump_entry.c`, manipulates the variables `trimmed_sgr0` and `my_sgr`. The values of these variables are pointers to character buffers. Operations that are performed include comparing the character buffer denoted by `trimmed_sgr0` to that which is denoted by `capability`, and then reassigning the value of `set_attributes` based on the outcome of that comparison. These actions are encompassed within an `if` statement. \n\nWhenever certain input files are being processed by NCurses, an illegitimate operation in memory is performed, which will cause the application to crash. The exact cause of the crash is reported differently, depending on the memory debugging tool that is used. Both a heap buffer overflow and a comparison to a uninitialized variable being reported as the cause of the crash. This crash arises due to errors that occur whenever null characters are present at certain locations within the application's input. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the program using a crafted file as input.",
