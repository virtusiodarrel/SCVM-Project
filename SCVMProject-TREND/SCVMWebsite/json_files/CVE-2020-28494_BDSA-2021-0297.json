    "title": "Total.js Vulnerable to Command Injection via Malicious File Upload in 'image.js' File",
    "description": "Total.js does not properly validate image files that are uploaded by the users. This could allow an attacker to upload a malicious image file that can later cause malicious commands to be executed on the server.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability originates in the `image.js` file. This file does not validate the appropriate image types (`type` parameter) that should be allowed for being uploaded. An attacker could upload a crafted file that contains malicious commands.  The `type` parameter is later used in commands that are executed during the execution of `child_process.spawn()` This issue occurs in `ImageProto.stream` and `ImageProto.pipe` functions. Because of the lack of sanitization measures for `type`, an attacker can inject malicious commands which will execute on the server.\nThis issue was fixed by introducing validation for the `type` variable in `image.js`.",
