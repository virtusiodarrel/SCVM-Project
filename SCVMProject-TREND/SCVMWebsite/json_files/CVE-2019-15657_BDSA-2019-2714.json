    "title": "eslint-utils Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via 'getStaticValue()' Function",
    "description": "eslint-utils is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the unsafe handling of client-provided input. An attacker could execute arbitrary code on a victim's system by tricking them into running the application using crafted input that specifies a malicious `node` object.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `getStaticValue()`, which is defined within the script `get-static-value.js`, is used by `eslint-utils` in order to get the value of a given node, provided that node is a static value. This serves as a wrapper for the `getStaticValueR()` function, which accepts a node and a scope as input. These are associated with the `node` and `intialScope` variables, respectively. Depending on the properties of the `node` object, various other functions can be evaluated in order to obtain the return value of `getStaticValueR()`. These functions are defined within the `operations` construct and include `CallExpression()`, `ExpressionStatement()` and `ObjectExpression()`. These functions allow for methods defined within the `node` object to be called with client-controlled arguments, and are selected by accessing `operations` using the `node.type`property as an index. It is therefore possible for an attacker to provide a crafted `node` object that will cause the call stack of `getStaticValue()` to evaluate malicious code by exploiting one of the functions defined within `operations`. In order to achieve this, they must be able to trick a user into running the application using crafted input.",
