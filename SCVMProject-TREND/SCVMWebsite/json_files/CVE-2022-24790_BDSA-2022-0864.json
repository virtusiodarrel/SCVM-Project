    "title": "Puma Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling via Improper HTTP Request Parsing due to Improper Front-End Proxy Configuration",
    "description": "Puma is vulnerable to improper HTTP request parsing when a front-end proxy does not validate incoming HTTP requests according to the `RFC7230` standard. This could allow an attacker to smuggle malicious HTTP requests into Puma via the front-end proxy.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability arises when a front-end proxy does not validate incoming HTTP requests according to the `RFC7230` standard. In such cases, Puma and the proxy server may disagree on where the HTTP request starts/ends. This can lead to improper parsing of HTTP headers like `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`. Also, the ending of chunked segments could be improperly parsed. An attacker could exploit these flaws and smuggle malicious HTTP requests into the application via the front-end proxy.\nThis issue was fixed by adding validation measures in order to ensure that incoming HTTP requests are properly parsed by the application.",
