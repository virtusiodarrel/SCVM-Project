    "title": "Xpdf Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Infinite Loop in Page Tree Parsing Process",
    "description": "Xpdf is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to an infinite loop which leads to the exhaustion of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `gAtomicIncrement()`, defined within `GMutex.h`, is called by Xpdf during the process of parsing the page tree for the input PDF file. Each time this function is called, an additional stack frame is  created. Page tree parsing is controlled via a loop, which continues until all of the nodes in the tree have been processed. For certain input PDF files, the exit condition for the loop that controls page tree parsing is unattainable. Although Xpdf checks for infinite loops at some code locations, it does not apply these checks consistently. The page tree parsing loop is not subjected to these checks, and will continue indefinitely. The continuous generation of stack frames will eventually exhaust all available stack memory resources. A subsequent attempt to will constitute an invalid memory access operation, halting program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running Xpdf using a crafted input file that will trigger this infinite loop.",
