    "description": "Nextcloud is vulnerable to information disclosure.  This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to obtain basic user information due to a in issue within the federated share functionality.",
    "technicalDescription": "The information disclosure vulnerability arises when the setting, \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" is enabled. \nThis setting will automatically add other Nextcloud servers registered users once a federated share is created successfully. \n\nA public link can be added as a federated share, an attacker can abuse this if they have access to a public link, and use this to disclose information about registered users.",
