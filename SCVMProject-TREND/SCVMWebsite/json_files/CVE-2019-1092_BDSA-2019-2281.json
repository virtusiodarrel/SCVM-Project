    "description": "The ChakraCore scripting engine has a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability due to how it handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by getting a victim to visit a crafted website or crafted content on a website, using the Microsoft Edge browser.",
    "technicalDescription": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakracore scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge. The flaw allows out-of-bounds read and write operations to occur in the JIT engine through the source file `lib/Backend/GlobOptBlockData.cpp`.\n\nThis remote code execution vulnerability can be leveraged by an attacker to corrupt memory and gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user has administrative user rights, the attacker can take control of an affected system and install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. \n\nAn attacker can host a specially crafted website, take advantage of a compromised website or leverage a website that accepts user-provided content or advertisements, and convince a user to visit it using Microsoft Edge.",
