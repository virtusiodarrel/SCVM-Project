    "title": "October Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Improper Privilege Management in 'registerBackendPermissions()' Function",
    "description": "October content management system (CMS) contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the improper management of privileges for certain user roles. An authenticated attacker with access to the backend could exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges to those of a developer.",
    "technicalDescription": "Due to improper restrictions on the default permissions granted to users with the `Publisher` system role, a malicious attacker with access to the backend can escalate their permissions to `Developer` access. This is due to the fact that `Publisher` users can create new users, and control the system role of those new users. The issue was addressed by increasing restrictions in the `registerBackendPermissions()` function in the `modules/backend/ServiceProvider.php` and `modules/system/ServiceProvider.php` files.",
