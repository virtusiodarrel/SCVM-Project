    "title": "PHPFusion Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'Main Settings' Component",
    "description": "PHPFusion is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient validation of client-provided input. A remote attacker with administrative credentials could execute malicious scripts in the browser of a victim by tricking them into viewing maliciously crafted content. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "A number of PHPFusion scripts, including `administration/settings_registration.php`. and `administration/settings_security.php`, generate HTML content dynamically using data that has been provided by clients with administrative credentials. These scripts attempt to sanitize dynamically-generated web content by removing script tags. This provides insufficient protection, as there are other ways of embedding XSS payloads in a web page. A remote attacker with administrative credentials could execute malicious scripts in the browser of a victim by embedding XSS payloads in dynamically generated content. Such payloads can be embedded via crafted POST requests.",
