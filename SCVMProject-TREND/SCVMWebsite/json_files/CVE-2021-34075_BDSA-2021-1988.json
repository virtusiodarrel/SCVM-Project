    "description": "Pandora FMS has insufficient security configurations in the File Manager. This can allow an attacker to gain access to the hash of the database password by monitoring the network traffic of an admin authenticated user.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in the File Manager, which is an admin feature of Pandora FMS. A hash is calculated on the server-side and is used to reach the files and directories, however it is also visible on the client-side. This md5 hash is calculated in file `include/functions_filemanager.php` and is made up from a simple string from the relative path and from the `db_password`. An attacker can take advantage of this by monitoring the network traffic of an admin authenticated user in order to gain access to the hash, from here they could potentially gain access to the relative path from the `db_password`.",
