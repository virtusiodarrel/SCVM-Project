    "description": "SDL2_image is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted PCX file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `IMG_LoadPCX_RW()`, which is defined within the source file `IMG_pcx.c`, contains code that is used by SDL2_image in order to load a PCX type image from an SDL datasource. This function utilizes the signed integer variable `bpl`, the value of which corresponds to the number of bytes per line. \n\nThe value of `bpl` is determined via the calculation `pcxh.NPlanes * pcxh.BytesPerLine`. The value that is determined will directly depend on the properties of the PCX file being processed. `IMG_LoadPCX_RW()` contains an `if` statement that checks whether or not `bpl > sizeof(surface->pitch)`. However, the execution flow of the program continues in the same manner, regardless of whether this condition is met or not.\n\nIf the condition `src_bits == 8` is met, the `dst` variable's value is set to that of `surface->pixels`. The value of `dst` is intended to correspond to the size of the buffer that will be written to by the function. However, the value of `bpl` determines how many bytes will actually be written. If `bpl > surface->pixels`, a buffer overflow event will occur. An attacker can therefore cause the application to write to invalid memory by providing a crafted PCX file, that will trigger this chain of events. This will cause the program to crash, constituting a DoS.",
