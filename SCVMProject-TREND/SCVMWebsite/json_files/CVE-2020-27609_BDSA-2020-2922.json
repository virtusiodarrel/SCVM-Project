    "description": "BigBlueButton is vulnerable to unauthorized data storage of video recordings. This occurs even when the session was not intentionally recorded.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability occurs when the `record=true` is specified in the front end of BigBlueButton, in order to allow recordings during a session. Then when a session is created that allows recording, BigBlueButton will record the whole sessions regardless of if the recording-button has been pressed or not.\n\nAdditionally BigBlueButton will store the presentations of sessions in `/var/bigbluebutton` even if the room is started with `record=false`.",
