    "description": "Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller could be confused into acting as one user when holding a ticket for another. Administrators with the right to create other user or machine accounts could impersonate highly privileged account and cause a total domain compromise.",
    "technicalDescription": "Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller is based on Kerberos, which provides name-based authentication. If PAC is not presented along with a Kerberos ticket, Samba allows falling back to using the name in the ticket alone (while it is valid, often 10 hours or more). Delegated administrators with the right to create other user or machine accounts can abuse the race between the time of ticket issue and the time of presentation (back to the AD DC) to impersonate a different account, including a highly privileged account.\n\nTo fix the issue, Samba as an AD DC will now always issue a Kerberos PAC in the AD-REQ and require that tickets presented back to the DC have a PAC, both in the KDC and elsewhere.",
