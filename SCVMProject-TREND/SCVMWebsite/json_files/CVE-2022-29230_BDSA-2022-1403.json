    "description": "Hydrogen is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue due to a lack of sufficient sanitization of user controlled input.\n\nThis issue could allow an attacker to submit a crafted input in order to execute scripts on pages that are built with Hydrogen.",
    "technicalDescription": "To remedy this issue, the vendor first temporarily removed the `flight` variable and related code from the `render` function in the `packages/hydrogen/src/entry-server.tsx` file. In a later release this change was reverted and the new `htmlEncode` function was introduced in the `packages/hydrogen/src/utilities/html-encoding.ts` file in order to properly sanitize script tag content. See **Solution** for more information.",

    "solution": "`Flight` related code was temporarily removed in **0.19.0** with [this](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/c188865255c5f20d9db285e375c57127030e23e6) commit. Although this fixed the issue, it involved removing code rather than sanitizing it.\n\nThis vulnerability is fixed in [**0.21.0**](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/releases/tag/%40shopify%2Fhydrogen%400.21.0) where `Flight` related code was reinstated and script escaping code was added with [this](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/e378ed6199553f64d9e73ad27f9409ef501aa724) commit.\n\nThe latest stable releases are available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/hydrogen).",
