    "description": "PyBitmessage is vulnerable to information exposure via crafted `apinotifypath` values. An attacker could exploit this in order to take screen captures and save to specific directories.\n\n**Note:** This issue is disputed by the discoverer due to a lack of evidence to support that the screen captures can be transported away from the local host.",
    "technicalDescription": "In some instances this issue means it is possible to view full-resolution screenshot images of the graphical user interface that have been generated to a subfolder. This issue is disputed because it is unclear whether there are any cases in which an attacker could gain control of `apinotifypath`.",

Confine the PyBitmessage application to a secure sandbox that blocks all calls to the screen.\n2. Run PyBitmessage sandboxed in daemon mode and use a alternative, trusted interface to connect to the API.\n3. Deploy Bitmessage protocol interface using a graphics system that is segregated from Python, ImageMagick and Muffin WM, the latter being heavily dependent upon Python.\n4. Do not use the `apinotifypath` feature of PyBitmessage for any Python application. The Pythonic recursion of import calls contributes to the erratic behavior.\n\n**Note:** Python interpreter does a lot of memory mapping access. It is possible that recursive import calls from subscripts may open up access to memory, making it writable from within a Python module or application.\"",
