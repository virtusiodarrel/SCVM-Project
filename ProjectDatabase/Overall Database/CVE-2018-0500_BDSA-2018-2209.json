    "title": "Curl Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Heap-based Buffer Overflow in 'Curl_smtp_escape_eob' Function",
    "description": "Curl is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to an error with memory allocation when sending data over SMTP in certain situations. An attacker could leverage this flaw to crash the application and cause a potentially exploitable memory corruption.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in the `Curl_smtp_escape_eob()` function of the `lib/smtp.c` source file. When preparing to send data over SMTP, curl allocates memory for a \"scratch area\" on the heap for the purposes of escaping the uploaded data if needed. The size of this scratch area was accidentally set to be `2 * sizeof(download_buffer)` instead of `2 * sizeof(upload_buffer)` resulting in an exploitable flaw. Both buffers are 16KB in size by default, however since version [**7.54.1**](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/e40e9d7f0decc799e3ccfe2c418632f8bb52031a), the download buffer can be resized by using the `--limit-rate` switch.\n\nThis may lead to an overflow of the scratch buffer in the `Curl_smtp_escape_eob()` function if the download buffer is set to a value smaller than 10923. An attacker could leverage this flaw by tricking a user to use curl to upload data over SMTP with a specified buffer size to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by an application crash or to corrupt the memory. Although unproven, this memory corruption can potentially be weaponized and leveraged for arbitrary code execution.",
