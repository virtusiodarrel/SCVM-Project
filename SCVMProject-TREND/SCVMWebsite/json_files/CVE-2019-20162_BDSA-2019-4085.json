    "description": "GPAC is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function  `gf_isom_box_parse_ex()`, which is defined within the file `box_funcs.c`, performs operations on the structure `newBox`. This structure is contained within heap memory and contains a variety of fields, such as `type` and `internal_4cc`. The aforementioned function will attempt to write data to the components contained in this structure, through both `memcpy` and standard assignment operations. Whenever certain input files are being processed by the application, this function will attempt to write a quantity of data to one of these components which is larger than the size of that component in memory. This constitutes a heap buffer overflow. If the application attempts to write this data to an invalid memory address, an exception will occur and program execution will be halted. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the application using a crafted file as input, which will trigger the aforementioned buffer overflow whenever it is being processed.",
