    "description": "Buildah is vulnerable to a path traversal flaw. An attacker could trick a user in to building a malicious container image hosted on an HTTP(s) server. The attacker could then write to files outside the working directory on the client machine as long as the user has permissions.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in Buildah during the container image building process. If it fails to fetch the content used as a parameter for building it attempts to fetch it again without properly cleaning up the build directory. This could potentially be leveraged by an attacker crafting a malicious input that would force Buildah to overwrite any existing file for which the task owner has write access.",
