    "description": "OTRS Community Edition is vulnerable to information exposure due to insufficient restrictions on the storage of authentication keys in Generated Support Bundles. This could allow a privileged attacker to obtain private S/MIME and PGP keys on a system where the containing folder is not hidden.\n\n**Note**: This vulnerability has also been disclosed as **CVE-2021-36096** (**BDSA-2021-2719**). OTRS have stated [here](https://otrs.com/release-notes/attention-security-risk-with-otrs-6/) that OTRS 6 and ((OTRS)) Community Edition 6 have reached end of life and will receive no further security updates after **2021-01-01**. The source code [repository](https://github.com/OTRS/otrs) has been archived and no updates were applied to mitigate this vulnerability. See **Workaround** for more information.",
