    "description": "Care2x is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issues due to a lack of sufficient sanitization of multiple user-controlled parameters.\n\nAn authenticated attacker could abuse these flaws by sending POST request to the `patient_register.php` page an include malicious scripts in the affected parameters. This could allow the attacker to execute scripts in the context of a victim user's browser that renders the tainted content which could allow for the theft of cookies or tampering of the webpage. The issue reporter has claimed [here](https://securityforeveryone.com/blog/care2x-hospital-information-management-system-0-day-vulnerability-cve-2021-36352) that this issue could be used to perform a user account takeover.",
