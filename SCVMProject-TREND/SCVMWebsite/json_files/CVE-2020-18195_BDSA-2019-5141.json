    "title": "Pluck CMS Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via Multiple '/admin.php?action=' Actions",
    "description": "Pluck CMS contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.  This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crafted links that, if clicked on by an authenticated administrator, will perform actions on their behalf. \n\nThe vulnerable actions include deleting content such as images, theme topics, modules and articles.",
    "technicalDescription": "The CSRF vulnerability is due to the lack of a CSRF token being used when performing actions to delete content.  The `/admin.php?action=` URL can be modified to perform actions such as :\n* `deleteimage`\n* `theme_delete`\n* `module_delete`\n* `deletepage`.\n\nThe attack vector for this vulnerability requires that a victim has administrative access to Pluck CMS and is authenticated to a site before clicking on a crafted action.  A remote attacker could use phishing attacks targeting such a victim.  The actions will all delete content from a site, however, it is stated that the deleted content will only move to \"trash\" and can be simply restored. \n\nThe vendor has marked this issue as \"Wont Fix\" as it is deemed to have such a low security impact.",
