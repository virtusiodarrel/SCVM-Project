    "description": "TYPO3 CMS is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to uncontrolled recursion in Page Error Handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n**Note**: This issue was originally fixed by the vendor, but later a regression was introduced during TYPO3 **v11** development. The regression was reported separately as **CVE-2022-36104** (**BDSA-2022-2552**). See **Solution** for more information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP will trigger the page error handler that could also retrieve content to be displayed as an error message from another page. This can lead to a scenario where the application is calling itself recursively until the limits of the web server are exceeded.\n\nIt was mitigated by ensuring that the content of the **404** error page is now cached. Any dynamic content on the error page will therefore also be cached.\n\n**Note:** If dynamic content is required on the **404** error page, the vendor recommends that a custom PHP based error handler is implemented.",
