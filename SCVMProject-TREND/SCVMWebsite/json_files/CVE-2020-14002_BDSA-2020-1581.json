    "description": "PuTTY is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks due to an information leak during the key exchange process. A remote attacker could obtain information or modify data by tricking a client into connecting to an attacker controlled server.\n\n**Note**: This  vulnerability can only occur if you are using an SSH agent.",
    "technicalDescription": "Whenever a PuTTY client connects to a server, a key exchange process occurs. During this key exchange, there is an information leak, as the exchange messages that are sent by clients that possess the host key of the target server will differ from those that do not possess the host key. \n\nAn attacker will then be able to conduct a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack against clients that do not have the host key whenever they attempt to connect for the first time. The attacker can achieve this provided they can trick the victim into connecting to an attacker-controlled server, and that the victim does not compare the signature of the provided key to a real reference value. This could potentially allow the attacker to obtain or modify sensitive information.\n\nHowever, as PuTTY uses `ssh-ed25519` as their default algorithm, this means that the users that have stored an `ssh-ed25519` key and users that connect for the first time are difficult for an attacker to distinguish between. Therefore, there is always a risk of triggering an alert for the user which provides a warning of an ongoing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.",
