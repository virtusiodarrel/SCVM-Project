    "description": "Backdrop content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the improper sanitization of client-provided input. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the content creation interface due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could create a malicious content type name which constitutes a XSS payload via this interface, which will then be executed within the browser of a victim who is attempting to create new content. This could potentially allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.\n\nThe Vendor has addressed this issue by specifying `'localized_options' => array('html' => FALSE)` in the `core/modules/node/node.pages.inc` file.",
