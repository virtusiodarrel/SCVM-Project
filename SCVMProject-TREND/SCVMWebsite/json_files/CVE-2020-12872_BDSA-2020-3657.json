    "description": "Yaws is vulnerable to a birthday attack when using  weak ciphers such as DES and 3DES, due to small (64-bit) block size.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability occurs due to the underlying Erlang/OTP and OpenSSL versions in Yaws using weak ciphers such as DES and 3DES.\n\nWhen encrypting data, algorithms will break the data up into blocks.  The block size *n* is an important parameter for determining the security of a cryptosystem.  In order to avoid plaintext collisions (i.e. two different plaintexts, encrypted under the same key, producing the same ciphertext) they key should be changed before 2^n/2 blocks.  For modern cryptosystems which use 128-bit blocks, it would require 256 exobytes of data to be collected before such a collision would be observed.  With 64-bit blocks, it requires only 32GB.  Depending on the protocols involved, this volume of traffic could be observed over the course of hours or days.\n\nIn order for this attack to be successful, the following must be true: you must have a known plaintext block, you must have the corresponding ciphertext of the known plaintext block and you must have the ciphertext of the unknown plaintext block which you are trying to decrypt.  With all three it is possible to compute the plaintext of the unknown ciphertext.\n\nAn attacker could use this by intercepting all the traffic from the server to discover sensitive information.\n\nThe Vendor has mitigated against this by ensuring the underlying Erlang/OTP and OpenSSL versions are the most up to date and are mitigated against this attack.",
