    "title": "Exiv2 Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via 'Exiv2::PngImage::printStructure' Function",
    "description": "Exiv2 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could obtain information about the contents of the process's memory by tricking the victim into running the program using a maliciously crafted input file.\n\nIt should be noted that this vulnerability is disputed by the vendor, who has been unable to reproduce it.",
    "technicalDescription": "The  function `PngImage::printStructure()`, which is defined within `pngimage.cpp`, operates dynamically on a variety of in-memory structures and buffers, including `io_` and `cheaderBuf`. Whenever certain malformed input files are being processed by the application, an illegal memory access operation occurs that reveals information about the contents of the process's memory. An attacker could therefore obtain potentially sensitive information by tricking a victim into running the program with a maliciously crafted input file. This could assist the attacker in further exploiting the victim's system.\n\nIt should be noted that this vulnerability is disputed by the vendor, who has been unable to reproduce it.",
