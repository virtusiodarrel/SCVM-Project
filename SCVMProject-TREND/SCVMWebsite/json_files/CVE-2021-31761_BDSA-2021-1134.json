    "title": "Webmin Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Running Process Functionality when Installed with 'setup.pl' Script",
    "description": "Webmin, when installed using the `setup.pl` script that is against vendor advice, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to a lack of referer validation. This issue can abused to perform remote code execution (RCE). A remote attacker could execute malicious code in a victim user's browser which could be leveraged to launch a reverse shell on the target system.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated [here](https://www.webmin.com/security.html) and [here](https://github.com/webmin/webmin/issues/1479#issuecomment-827468302) that this issue only affects Webmin if it was installed using the `setup.pl` script. The standard RPM, Deb, TAR and Solaris packages do not use this script and are therefore not affected.",
    "technicalDescription": "When Webmin is installed with the non-recommended `setup.pl` script, the checks for unknown referers are not enabled by default. This can allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to be performed. In this case, the vulnerability exists in Webmin's running process feature. Attackers could exploit this flaw by tricking a Webmin administrator into clicking on a crafted link to the  `/tunnel/link.cgi` endpoint.  This malicious link could contain an XSS payload which, if the attack is successful, can allow for the attacker to open a reverse shell.",
