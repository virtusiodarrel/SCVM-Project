    "description": "OTRS Community Edition is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue due to a lack of sufficient input sanitization in the ticket overview screens.\n\nAn attacker could send a crafted email to the OTRS system in order to execute malicious scripts against victim users who happen to view the affected content.\n\n**Note**: OTRS have stated [here](https://otrs.com/release-notes/attention-security-risk-with-otrs-6/) that OTRS 6 and ((OTRS)) Community Edition 6 have reached end of life and will receive no further security updates after **2021-01-01**. The source code [repository](https://github.com/OTRS/otrs) has been archived and no updates were applied to mitigate this vulnerability. See **Workaround** for more information.",
    "technicalDescription": "OTRS Community Edition is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) because the date and time data displayed on in the ticket overview screens is not sufficiently sanitized. A crafted email could cause these fields to contain malicious content that is executed in the browser context of victim users who view the tainted content.",
