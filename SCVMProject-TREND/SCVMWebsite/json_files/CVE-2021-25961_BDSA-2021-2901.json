    "title": "SuiteCRM Vulnerable to Account Takeover Attacks via Insufficient Invalidation of Password Reset Links",
    "description": "SuiteCRM is vulnerable to an account takeover issue due to how password reset links are not properly invalidated for deleted user IDs.\n\nThis issue could mean that if an attacker obtains a password reset link that is associated with a deleted user ID, they could take over the account of a newly created user that uses the previously deleted ID.",
    "technicalDescription": "To remedy this issue, the vendor has added extra validation in the `modules/Users/Changenewpassword.php` file to check if a given `userBean` is still active, and if it is not, to set the password reset link to expired.",
