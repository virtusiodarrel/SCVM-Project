    "title": "BlackCat Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'Admin-Tools' Feature",
    "description": "BlackCat CMS is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper validation of user-supplied input. This could allow an attacker with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal sensitive information such as authentication tokens and user session cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The component does not properly sanitize the 'Name' field of the 'Output Filters' and 'Droplets' sections in the admin panel. This can allow an attacker to supply maliciously crafted scripts to these fields which if accessed by a victim will be executed on their system.",
