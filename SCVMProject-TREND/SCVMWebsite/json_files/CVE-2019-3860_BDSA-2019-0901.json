    "description": "libssh2 is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by supplying crafted SFTP packets in response to client requests from a malicious server.",
    "technicalDescription": "A running instance of libssh2  handles responses to SFTP messages using a variety of functions, which are defined in the script `sftp.c`. These functions dynamically allocate memory using the `memset` function. The dynamically allocated memory is used to store the contents of the received SFTP responses, which is then accessed using a variety of indexes. However, no validation is performed to ensure that the packets are of the expected size. This can cause an out-of-bounds access exception to be triggered whenever the memory pointed to by a given index is dereferenced. An attacker could cause a DoS by supplying response packets that are smaller than what is expected. For example, packets with an empty payload could be used.",
