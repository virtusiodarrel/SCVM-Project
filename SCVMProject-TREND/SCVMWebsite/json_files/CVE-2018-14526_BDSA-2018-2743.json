    "title": "wpa_supplicant Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Sensitive Information Disclosure via EAPOL-Key Frames",
    "description": "wpa_supplicant has a flaw in how it processes EAPOL-Key frames. A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by modifying GTK/IGTK. In certain circumstances it may be possible for an attacker within range of the access point to gain some knowledge of group encryption keys.",
    "technicalDescription": "A flaw in `rsn_supp/wpa.c` in wpa_supplicant allows an attacker to cause a DoS or gain access to sensitive information. \n\nThe issue arises when wpa_supplicant processes EAPOL-Key frames where the WPA2/RSN style of EAPOL-Key construction is used with TKIP negotiated as the pairwise cipher. An attacker can modify the frame in a way that makes wpa_supplicant decrypt the Key Data field without the frame being authenticated (no valid MIC value).\n\nA remote attacker can cause a DoS attack by modifying GTK/IGTK on the station thus preventing the station from accepting received group-addressed frames. It is also possible for an attacker within range of the access point and client to make the wpa_supplicant act as a decryption oracle to recover some of the Key Data payload (GTK/IGTK). \n\nFull recovery of the group encryption keys is difficult to achieve as an attacker would need to control a large number of stations and have them connect to the same AP to be able to recover sufficient information from the GTK to be able to determine the key before it gets changed.",
