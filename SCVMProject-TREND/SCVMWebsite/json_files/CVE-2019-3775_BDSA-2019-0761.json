    "description": "An improper authentication vulnerability has been discovered in Cloud Foundry UAA. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying their own account email to that of another user. If successful, it is possible to launch spoofing attacks or other malicious actions against the system.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in Cloud Foundry UAA which can result in identity spoofing or other malicious actions. The SCIM API implemented in the application allows registered users to modify their own email addresses. The issue occurs due to no validation against which emails are being utilized by other users, which allows an authenticated user to impersonate other users of the system. \n\nThe `isAllowed` function located in the file `server/src/main/java/org/cloudfoundry/identity/uaa/security/ScimUserSelfUpdateAllowed.java` did not prevent users from self-updating their own email address.",
