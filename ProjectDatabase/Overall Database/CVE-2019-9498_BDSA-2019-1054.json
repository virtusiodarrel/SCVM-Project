    "description": "An insufficient verification of data authenticity vulnerability has been discovered in wpa_supplicant utilized by the WPA3 protocol. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness in the WPA3 protocol design could lead to reflection attacks against the system. WPA3 utilizes a key agreement method called simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) which is a variant of the Dragonfly Key Exchange. The attack works by first initiating a connection to the target. The target attempts to authenticate the attacker by sending a challenge. The attacker opens up a second connection to the target, using the challenge they just obtained as their own challenge. The result that the server sent back can be sent as the response of the initial challenge. This is due to the same protocol being used on both sides of the authentication mechanism.\n\nThe extensible authentication protocol (EAP) password server process is handled in the file `src/eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c`. It was discovered the function `eap_pwd_process_commit_resp` did not contain a process to verify the scalar or element values from a received commit frame against the values utilized by the authentication server. This could cause commit frames containing invalid scalar/elements to be accepted by the server completing the EAP-PWD authentication process.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by forging malicious commit frames to cause heavy resource consumption and trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
