    "description": "October CMS is vulnerable to improper neutralization of HTTP headers. Attackers that successfully exploit this flaw could perform HTTP response splitting or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists due to the application not neutralizing client-supplied data in the headers of HTTP responses. Attackers could exploit this by submitting requests that contain maliciously crafted `Host` headers to a vulnerable server. The attacker can cause HTTP response splitting, or could execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim. The vendor addressed this by implementing an allowed a set of trusted hosts to be specified in the application.",
