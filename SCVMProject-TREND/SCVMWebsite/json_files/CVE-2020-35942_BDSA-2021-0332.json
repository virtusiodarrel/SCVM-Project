    "description": "NextGEN Gallery Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE), local file inclusion, and cross-site scripting (XSS) via cross-site request forgery (CSRF). An attacker could exploit this by tricking an admin user in to uploading a malicious file with a `.css` extension.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `is_authorized_request` function within the `nextgen_admin/class.nextgen_admin_page_controller.php` file due to improper permission restrictions. It meant that requests would be permitted if the `$_REQUEST[\u2018nonce\u2019]` parameter was absent. It was mitigated by the addition of checks which ensure that the user has permission to access the requested page. \n\nAdditionally the plugin has a `Legacy Templates` feature whereby users can choose how a gallery is viewed. This meant it was possible to set an album type to utilize a template with the absolute path of the previously uploaded file, or to perform directory traversal using the relative path of the uploaded file. It was mitigated by depreciating the `Legacy Templates` feature.",
