    "title": "Info-ZIP UnZip Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Overlapping Local Entries",
    "description": "Info-Zip is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to issues in how the `.zip` format and the `DEFLATE` algorithm operate whenever files inside a zip container overlap. An attacker could cause the excessive consumption of resources on a victim's system by tricking them into uncompressing a crafted `zip` file. This could lead to the victim's system crashing altogether.",
    "technicalDescription": "Info-Zip implements the `DEFLATE` algorithm for the compression of files. This algorithm is implemented in a non-recursive manner, making the application resistant to recursive ZIP bomb attacks. However, it is possible to overlap file headers in a `.zip` container such that the compression ratio achieved vastly exceeds the usual limit of `1032` that is associated with the `DEFLATE` algorithm. This means that a single round of decompression will cause the compressed file to vastly expand in size, consuming a detrimental amount of memory and CPU resources. An attacker could therefore cause a victim's system to crash by tricking them into decompressing a crafted `zip` file.",
