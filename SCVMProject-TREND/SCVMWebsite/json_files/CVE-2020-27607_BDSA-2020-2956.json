    "title": "BigBlueButton Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Flawed 'Mute' Functionality",
    "description": "BigBlueButton is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue due to how the client-side 'Mute' functionality does not completely stop the client from sending audio to the server.\n\nAn attacker could potentially manipulate the server to record this audio from users who think that they are muted, or attempt to record and decrypt audio on the network level.",
    "technicalDescription": "BigBlueButton is vulnerable to information disclosure because the client-side 'Mute' functionality does not halt recording of the user and instead can still transmit audio to the server. \n\nIn a default scenario, muted microphones are not recorded server-side. However, an attacker could modify the server to include a malicious script hooked to the FreeSWITCH component in order to record and/or transmit the audio of muted clients.",
