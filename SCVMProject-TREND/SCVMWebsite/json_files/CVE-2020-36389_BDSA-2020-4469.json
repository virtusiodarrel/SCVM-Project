    "title": "CiviCRM Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via Insufficient Protections in CKEditor Functionality",
    "description": "CiviCRM is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) issue due to a lack of anti-CSRF protection measures in the CKEditor functionality.\n\nAn attacker could abuse this flaw in order to trick a victim administrator into changing the configuration.",
    "technicalDescription": "CiviCRM is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) because the CKEditor configuration form does not sufficiently validate the source of incoming requests. An attacker could trick a victim administrator that is logged into CiviCRM into accessing a malicious site that sends a request to CKEditor on their behalf. This could be used by the attacker to change the configuration in order to aid further attacks.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated [here](https://civicrm.org/advisory/civi-sa-2020-12-xss-ckeditor-configuration) that the CKEditor contains another vulnerability (a cross-site scripting issue) and this could increase the impacts if combined.",
