    "title": "XStream Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Crafted Input Stream",
    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) by a remote attacker who can supply a specially crafted input stream to modify or inject objects. This allows them to request data from the internal network that the XStream application is hosted on.",
    "technicalDescription": "XStream is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery when running without a sufficient blacklist / whitelist configuration because dangerous type information can be processed. At unmarshalling time, during the processing of a stream, XStream uses type information to recreate the objects from supported formats, such as XML and JSON. An attacker can utilize this feature and include an arbitrary URL that references an internal resource to perform SSRF attacks.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated that XStream users who have set up the XStream security framework with a sufficient whitelist limited to the minimal required types are unaffected by this issue.",
