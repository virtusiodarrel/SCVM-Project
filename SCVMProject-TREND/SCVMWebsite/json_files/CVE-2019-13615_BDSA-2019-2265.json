    "description": "VLC Media Player is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `Open()`, which is defined within `mkv.cpp`, is used to initialize Matroska demultiplexer structures within VLC Media Player. During this function's execution, the function `demux_sys_t::FreeUnused()` will be called. This function is defined within the script `demux.cpp` and is used to free heap memory that has been used to store elements of the Matroska structure. This function uses two `for` loops in conjunction with the iterator variable `i` to advance through chunks of memory and erase their contents. Whenever a `.mp4`file possessing certain properties is being processed, the value of `i` can be incremented to a value that, when used as an index, it will resolve to a location that lies outside of the memory buffer being processed. This constitutes a buffer over-read, and can result in an exception being raised. This will halt program execution, effectively causing a DoS. An attacker could therefore cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a crafted `.mp4` file as input.",
