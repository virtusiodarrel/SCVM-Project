    "title": "Bareos Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via Client-Director Connections",
    "description": "Bareos contains an authentication bypass vulnerability, allowing a client to communicate with the director without the use of a shared secret. A malicious attacker can take advantage of this by initiating an unauthorized connection with the director.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability is due to insufficient checks during the the `CramMd5Handshake` in the `core/src/lib/cram_md5.cc` file of Bareos.\n\nA malicious attacker can send a client connect request to the director, when the director responds with a `CRAM-MD5` challenge, the attacker can replay this challenge to the director. The subsequent response from the director can be used by the attacker to send a valid reply to the directors original challenge, therefore initiating an unauthorized connection with the director. \n\nThe vendor has mitigated against this vulnerability by checking for a replay in the CRAM-MD5 challenge.",

As a matter of fact, when you enable client initiated connections you have to disable `Connection From Director to Client` (which defaults to \"yes\").\n> \n> As a simple rule, every client with `Connection From Client To Director = yes` must also set `Connection From Director To Client = no`.",
