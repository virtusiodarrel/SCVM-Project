    "description": "TensorFlow is vulnerable to information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper accessing of system memory resources. An attacker could potentially obtain memory addresses from the process by generating maliciously crafted computational graphs. They could also cause the application to crash.",
    "technicalDescription": "TensorFlow contains functionality for producing computational graphs. This involves creating edges between nodes, each of which has an associated tensor. This is performed via the `MakeEdge()` function of file `graph_constructor.cc`. Each tensor contains an array of values in memory, the values of which are accessed via indices. The edge-drawing process involves mapping an index for the `src` node tensor to its associated index within the `dst` node tensor. For each `src` tensor index, no checks are performed to ensure that an equivalent index exists within the `dst` node tensor. If an associated index does not exist, an out-of-bounds access will occur during the edge creation process. This can cause a segmentation fault, which will crash the process. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by causing the application to process maliciously crafted graph nodes. Under certain circumstances, the attacker may also be able to obtain informations that relates to memory addresses within the process.",
