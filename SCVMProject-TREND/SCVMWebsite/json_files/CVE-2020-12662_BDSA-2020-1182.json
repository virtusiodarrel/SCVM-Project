    "title": "Unbound Vulnerable to DNS Amplification via Improper Handling of Random NS Record Subdomains",
    "description": "Unbound is vulnerable to DNS amplification due to the improper handling of certain kinds of DNS records. A remote attacker could cause an Unbound server to generate large numbers of outgoing queries by sending maliciously crafted DNS traffic to that server. The server could therefore be used in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.",
    "technicalDescription": "Whenever Unbound is processing NS records that contain an unknown sub-domain in the `NSDNAME` of a NS delegation record, it must send out a request in order to get the associated IP address. Such records can be received during the iteration process. This behavior is implemented using a variety of functions, including `iter_lookup_parent_glue_from_cache()` of `iter_utils.c`, and `find_add_addrs` of `dns.c`. If the domain cannot be resolved, the server will attempt to resolve the next unknown sub-domain. This will continue for all of the unknown-sub domains, meaning that a large number of requests can potentially be generated by a server. A remote attacker could therefore cause amplification by sending a maliciously crafted delegation records containing random, non-existent sub domains. This could allow the attacker to use the server to conduct a DoS attack against another machine.",
