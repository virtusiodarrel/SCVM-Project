    "title": "Joomla! Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via MIME-Type Sniffing",
    "description": "Joomla! is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting due to a server configuration. An authenticated attacker could upload crafted files that containing malicious scripts that could be executed within the web browser of a victim who requests that file. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "It is possible to upload files to a site via its Joomla! interface that contain scripts, but in which the MIME type is not associated with script content. Clients can then access that file via a web browser, which may detect the discrepancy between the MIME type and the actual file contents. In such situations, the browser may attempt to detect (or 'sniff') the true nature of the file's contents, and then handle that content in an appropriate manner. If the file contains a script, it may automatically invoke the required interpreter in order to execute that script. Such a script may constitute a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload, having been placed there by an attacker with administrative access to the affected site's Joomla! interface. The XSS payload may allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
