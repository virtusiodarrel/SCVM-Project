    "title": "Bundler Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Git Repository in Gemfile",
    "description": "Bundler is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to incorrect user-provided option parsing for dependencies that come from Git repositories. An attacker that is able to trick a victim to use their crafted directory with a malicious `Gemfile` could execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a crafted a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency would need to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. Such URL will be used to construct a git clone command, but will be interpreted as the `upload-pack` argument. This is because of a flaw in Bundler that treats user input preceding with a dash as an optional argument instead of positional one. An attacker that is able to convince a victim to use their crafted directory and run a command that evaluates the malicious Gemfile could execute arbitrary commands.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by passing `--` to git commands to separate positional and optional arguments.",
