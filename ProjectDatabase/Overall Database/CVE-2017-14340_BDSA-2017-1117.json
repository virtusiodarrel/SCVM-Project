    "description": "XFS file system mishandles a user settable inode flag in kernels which can cause a local denial-of-service (DoS) via a kernel oops .",
    "technicalDescription": "The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.\nXFS is a 64-bit journaling file system used on Unix-like operating systems.\n\nIf the XFS kernel code is compiled with `CONFIG_XFS_RT=y`, the code mishandles `FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT` and `FS_XFLAG_REALTIME` flags when the file system does not have a real-time device configured. When an `fsync/fdatasync` operation is run on an inode (*data structure*) configured this way, the file system attempts to flush the cache of the non-existent real-time device and the kernel will oops (*a deviation from correct behavior*).\n\nWhile a user cannot set the `FS_XFLAG_REALTIME` directly on such a file system, kernel fails to prevent unprivileged user from setting the`FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT` on directories.  Hence files can inherit the problematic `FS_XFLAG_REALTIME` flag from their parent directory at create time. Setting the `FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT` flag does not require special privileges, so any user with permission to write to a directory can set it.\n\nThis vulnerability manifest itself on an affected system in the following scenario :\nIf using a kernel with `CONFIG_XFS_RT=y` and the `FS_XFLAG_RHINHERIT` flag is set on a directory in a file system that does not have a real time device and create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file. When data is written and a `fsync` is issued, the file system attempts to flush a non-existent real-time device during the `fsync` process. This results in a Denial of Service (*DoS*) via dereferencing a NULL pointer in `xfs_blkdev_issue_flush()`.\n\nIt can be leveraged by an unprivileged local user to cause a Denial of Service (*DoS*).\n\nBDSR have attributed an exploit available date to this vulnerability due to the efficacy of the Proof of Concept presented in advisory link.\n\nXFS file systems on all kernels since version **2.6.16** are vulnerable except for:\n\n* Kernels that are compiled with `CONFIG_XFS_RT=n` are not vulnerable.\n* XFS file systems with actual real-time devices are not vulnerable.",
