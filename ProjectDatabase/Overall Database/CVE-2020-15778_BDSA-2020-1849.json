    "title": "OpenSSH scp Vulnerable to Command Injection via Backtick Characters",
    "description": "The scp functionality in OpenSSH is vulnerable to command injection via backtick characters in the destination argument. The command will be run with the permissions of the user with which the files were copied on the remote server.  To exploit this issue an attacker must manipulate a system administrator into running `scp` with a malicious command line parameter. In addition it may be exploited in cases where copying of files via scp is permitted but running remote commands or logging in via ssh is not. \n\nThe vendor has reportedly stated that they intentionally omit validation of \"anomalous argument transfers\" to avoid \"breaking existing workflows.\"",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs due to how the `scp` command parses command line arguments. The `toremote()` function in `scp.c` does not perform sufficient sanitization of user-supplied data when creating the local SCP command. An attacker can exploit this by passing a payload surrounded by backticks as the file name.",
