    "title": "CISOfy Lynis Vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure via Data Upload Commands",
    "description": "CISOfy Lynis is vulnerable to sensitive data exposure via data upload commands. A local attacker could exploit this in order to view the license key via the process listing. This can occur while a data upload is happening.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `--upload` command within the `include/data_upload` file which contains the key within its parameters. It was mitigated by ensuring that a temporary file is created during upload so as to prevent the license key from appearing in the process table. \n\n**NOTE:** Per the vendor, the license key on its own will not grant access to system information but it may be utilized to waste system resources, use upload credits, or upload falsified data.",
