    "description": "Ruby on Rails is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to an incorrectly implemented security mechanism. A remote attacker could severely impact the performance or availability of a server by uploading an extremely large file to that server.",
    "technicalDescription": "The ActiveStorage component allows clients to directly upload files to a server. This process is mediated by the direct uploads controller. In order to make a direct upload, a client must submit a request that contains a number of parameters that describe the file. This include `filename`, `content_type`, `byte_size`, and `checksum`. The server will then generate a pre-signed URL using the `url_for_direct_upload()` function, which is defined within `s3_service.rb`. This pre-signed URL is then passed back to the browser. It is intended that the `byte_size` parameter is encoded into the pre-signed URL via the `Content-Length` header, in order to ensure that a client cannot upload a file that is of a different size to that which they specified in their request. However,  the `aws-sdk-s3` gem blacklists the `Content-Length` header silently, and so the header is not actually included in the presigned URL. This allows a user to upload a file that is larger than what the direct upload controller expects. A remote attacker could therefore upload extremely large file to the server, potentially causing a DoS.",
