    "title": "BIND Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Memory Corruption via Buffer Overflow in SPNEGO Implementation",
    "description": "BIND is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) and memory corruption via a buffer overflow in the SPNEGO implementation it uses. The most likely outcome of the vulnerability is a crash of the `named` process. The vendor has stated that remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. \n\nThe default BIND configuration does not expose the vulnerable code path but a server could be made vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the `tkey-gssapi-keytab` or `tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration` options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.",
    "technicalDescription": "GSS-TSIG is a TSIG extension which supports the secure exchange of keys for use in verifying the authenticity of communications between parties on a network. SPNEGO is a negotiation mechanism used by GSSAPI. The SPNEGO implementation used by BIND has been found to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.",
