    "title": "ELOG Vulnerable to Unintended Proxy via Crafted POST Requests",
    "description": "A vulnerability in ELOG was discovered that could allow the application to be manipulated as an unintended proxy. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could craft POST requests that will be proxied through ELOG as HTTP GET requests which could lead to other malicious actions against the target system. If an unlocked logbook is targeted, the attacker could download the server's response.",
    "technicalDescription": "It is possible for an attacker to abuse the file upload functionality to proxy HTTP GET request through ELOG. A remote unauthenticated attacker could craft a POST request with the `attfile` value as the URL URL of the GET request they want to proxy through the application. Unlocked logbooks could allow the attacker to download the server's response.",
