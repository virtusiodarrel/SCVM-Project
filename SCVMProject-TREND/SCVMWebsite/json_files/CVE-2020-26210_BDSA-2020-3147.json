    "description": "BookStack contains a vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper validation of user-supplied input. This can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the browser, allowing the theft of session tokens, cookies or other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists within the link attachment functionality. Attackers with permissions to edit a page could craft a malicious JavaScript input to be executed by the victim. This was addressed by filtering content from `javascript:` or `data:` URIs which is attached to attachments.",
