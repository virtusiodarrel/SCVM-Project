    "description": "VLC Media Player is vulnerable to denial-of-service due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the application using a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The MKV demuxer component within VLC Media Player is implemented using code contained in a variety of scripts, including `mkv.cpp` and `mkv.hpp`. This code creates and manipulates a variety of in-memory buffers whenever a file is being parsed. Data is written to, and read from, these buffers in a dynamic manner, depending on the properties of the file being parsed. Under certain circumstances, these buffer manipulation operations may attempt to manipulate memory that lies outside of the boundaries of the intended buffer. This could potentially cause an exception to be raised, halting program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by tricking a victim into running the program with a crafted file as input.",
