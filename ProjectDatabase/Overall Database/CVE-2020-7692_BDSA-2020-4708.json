    "title": "OAuth-Java-Client Vulnerable to Authorization Bypass via Missing PKCE Support",
    "description": "OAuth-Java-Client is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to the improper implementation of the OAuth protocol. An attacker that has obtained the authorization token that was given to a legitimate client could use that token to gain access to restricted resources on the vulnerable server.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `AuthorizationCodeFlow` class contains functionality that is used to provide clients with authorization codes. RFC 7636 states that OAuth clients which grant authorization codes must use PKCE in order to prevent authorization code interception attacks. The `AuthorizationCodeFlow` class does not utilize PKCE. An attacker that is able to obtain an authorization code that was granted to a legitimate client could use that code in order to gain access to restricted functionality on the server which granted the authorization code.",
