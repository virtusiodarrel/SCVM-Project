    "title": "OpenSSL Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Timing-Based Side Channel Attack Against Signing Algorithm",
    "description": "OpenSSL is vulnerable to information disclosure due to flaws within application's signing algorithm. An attacker could recover the private key using variations in the signing algorithm. This would allow the attacker to obtain the contents of messages that have been encrypted using that key.",
    "technicalDescription": "The OpenSSL DSA signature algorithm is implemented using functionality defined within `dsa_ossl.c`. This script utilizes the aggregate type `BIGNUM`, which is provided by the header file `openssl/bn.h`. The `BIGNUM` type allows for variables  that contain very large values to be declared. Such values are essential in conducting public key cryptographic operations. Part of the the DSA signature algorithm initialization process involves setting up these `BIGNUM` values. This is conducted within the function `dsa_sign_setup`, in which `BIGNUM` values are manipulated using functions such as `BN_set_bit`, `BN_add` and `BN_copy`.`BIGNUM` values may need to be resized during this setup process. The time consumed during the resizing process can leak information to attackers, which can ultimately allow them to determine the secret key that is calculated. This is because the values contained within `BIGNUM` variables are ultimately used in the private key calculation process.",
