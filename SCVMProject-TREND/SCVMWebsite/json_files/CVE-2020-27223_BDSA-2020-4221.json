    "title": "Jetty Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Unsafe Exponential Algorithm in 'sort()' Function",
    "description": "Jetty is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the use of an exponential algorithm that can have excessive resource requirements. A remote attacker could cause a vulnerable server to become unresponsive by sending maliciously crafted HTTP requests to that server.",
    "technicalDescription": "HTTP requests can contain an `Accept` header field, which specifies the MIME types that the client can accept in a response. Each type that is specified by the client can have an associated 'q-factor' weighting. The value of each q-factor is used to indicate the priority of that type. The server can then select an appropriate response MIME type based on this prioritization. The process of selecting a MIME type based on the values specified in the `Accept` header involves the use of a sorting algorithm. This algorithm is implemented using the `sort()` function, of file `QuotedQualityCSV.java`. This uses a `for` loop, which increments an index variable `i` and then uses that index to access each `Accept` header value in turn. These values are stored in the `_values` array. \n\nEach MIME type string will be extracted from `_values` and stored in the `v` variable, of type `String`. Each q-factor value is also extracted, and stored in the `q` variable (of type `Double`). Each q-factor will be compared to the one which was previously extracted. If there are differences, then an `if` statement code block will execute. This code block re-orders the contents of the `_values` array. The algorithm that performs this is exponential. As a result of this, if `_values` is large and there are many different q values (i.e. the sorting algorithm needs to be invoked many times), then a large number of CPU cycles are required to complete the function. If a single request contains tens of kilobytes and many different q-values, then the server may take minutes to process and respond to that request. If other clients are communicating with the server, they will experience a considerable delay before their requests are handled as well. A remote attacker could therefore cause a DoS by sending HTTP requests that contain maliciously crafted `Accept` header fields to a vulnerable server.\n\nIt should be noted that although an attacker can induce a lengthy delay in a server's response time, no memory is leaked and they cannot trigger a crash.",
