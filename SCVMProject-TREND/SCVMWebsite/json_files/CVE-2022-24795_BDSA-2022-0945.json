    "description": "RubyGems `yajl-ruby` package contains improper checks that can lead to an integer overflow that in turn causes heap memory corruption. An attacker could exploit this flaw by supplying large inputs to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS). \n\n**Note**: This issue only affects 32-bit systems.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue affects the code that exists in **1.x** and **2.x** branches of the repository. The `yajl_buf_ensure_available()` function in the `ext/yajl/yajl_buf.c` file contains the following check as a part of a while loop: \n`while (want >= (need - buf->used)) need <<= 1;`. When the value of `need` approaches the value `0x80000000`, it translates to a size close to 2GB. With this big an input, the value of `need`, which is a 32-bit integer, will wrap around to 0. This will thus cause integer overflow. In turn, this will lead to `buf->alloc` being reallocated into a small heap chunk, thus resulting in under-allocation. A heap memory corruption can occur when this small heap chunk is being repopulated based on the original buffer size, which is bigger. An attacker can exploit this flaw by supplying a large input and cause a denial-of-service.\n\nTo fix this issue, a new value `yajl_depth_underflow` has been introduced to perform proper validations.\n\n**Note**: This issue will only affect 32-bit systems. In the **2.x** branch, the affected integer variables have been defined using `size_t` which can only accommodate 32-bit integers on 32-bit systems. However, on a 64-bit system, this issue won't arise.",
