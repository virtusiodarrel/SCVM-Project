    "title": "LLPD Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Memory Leak During Multi-TLV Packet Processing",
    "description": "LLDP is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause the application to crash by causing it to process maliciously crafted packets.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `lldp_decode()`, of file `src/daemon/protocols/lldp.c`, is used to process packets that can contain a variety of TLV types (as specified in the `tlv_type` variable). This involves the dynamic allocation of memory. If the packets being processed contain multiple TLVs, then the application could potentially fail to free heap memory that is has previously acquired. This can lead to the exhaustion of memory resources, which could impact the application's performance and potentially cause a crash.\n\nThe issue was fixed by ensuring that `free()` is called at the necessary stages of the packet parsing process.",
