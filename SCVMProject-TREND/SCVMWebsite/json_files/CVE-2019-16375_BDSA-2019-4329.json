    "title": "OTRS Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Article Quoting Functionality",
    "description": "OTRS is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the improper validation of client-provided input. A remote authenticated attacker could cause an agent to execute malicious JavaScript by crafting a malicious article body. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as session cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "OTRS allows users to create articles that relate to a variety of ticket types. The functions that implement this feature perform some sanitization in order to remove any external content that has been referenced. However, they do not perform a sufficient level of sanitization to ensure that malicious scripts are not embedded in the article. A remote attacker who is able to authenticate as an agent or a customer with the necessary permissions could craft a malicious article that contains a XSS payload. This will then be executed whenever an agent composes an answer to that article.",
