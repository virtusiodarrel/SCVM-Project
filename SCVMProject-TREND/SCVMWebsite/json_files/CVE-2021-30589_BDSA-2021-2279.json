    "title": "Chromium Vulnerable to Unspecified Impacts via Insufficient Validation of Untrusted Input in 'Sharing'",
    "description": "Chromium is vulnerable to unspecified impacts via insufficient validation of untrusted input in `Sharing`. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a victim with maliciously crafted web content.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in multiple files relating to `Sharing` because phone numbers sent from a Chrome desktop instance to an Android phone as a link with a `tel` href were not validated. `GURL::GetContent()` was also called to get the number before it was double URL-encoded while in the process of constructing the `Dialer` intent. This meant that double-URL-encoded `USSD` `te`l links could be sent straight to the `Dialer`.\n\nIt was mitigated by the following amendments:\nDesktop:\n - URL-decode the number and ignore if it contains `#`, `*` or `%`\n - Send the raw number (URL-encoded) to Android\nAndroid:\n - Verify that the URL-decoding of the received raw number is valid as above\n - Show the decoded number in the notification\n - Parse the raw number in Java into a Uri object for the Dialer\n\nIn tandem these changes make sure that `tel:` links are only URL-decoded  once and they are verified on both the sender and receiver side before being passed to the Android Dialer.",
