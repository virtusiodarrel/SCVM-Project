    "title": "GetSimpleCMS Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via '.phar' File Upload in '/admin/upload.php' File",
    "description": "GetSimpleCMS is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the improper restriction of malicious files that may be uploaded via the admin file upload functionality. A user with administrative privileges could upload a file that would allow arbitrary command execution on the host once the file is accessed.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerable location is `/admin/upload.php`. It is possible to bypass `.phar` file upload restrictions by adding a picture file header information (such as `jpg`) to the file. The vulnerability was fixed by adding `application/php, application/x-httpd-php, application/x-httpd-php-source` to blacklisted MIME types and adding `.phar` to the extension blacklist in `admin/inc/security_functions.php`.",
