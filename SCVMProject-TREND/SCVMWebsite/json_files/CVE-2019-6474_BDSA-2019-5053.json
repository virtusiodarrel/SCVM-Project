    "title": "Kea Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Improper Lease Validation",
    "description": "Kea is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper handling of client requests, which can lead to a crash whenever a server tries to load stored leases after restarting. A network-adjacent attacker could cause a DoS by causing a vulnerable server to handle problematic requests.\n\nIt should be noted that only Kea servers that use `memfile` based lease storage are affected.",
    "technicalDescription": "Kea can use client requests to create leases, which are written to its lease store. Stored leases can have various states. If a client request is invalid, then the lease associated with that request will have its state set to `STATE_DECLINED`. This indicates that the lease has been rejected. Kea determines if a request is invalid by checking for properties such as an empty hardware address. However, the checks that are performed are not robust. For example, the function `CSVLeaseFile4::append()` of file `csv_lease_file4.cc` fails to detect if the client ID of a request is blank. \n\nAs a result of this, the lease store can end up containing leases that are malformed, but have not had their state set to `STATE_DECLINED`. Whenever the server restarts, it will attempt to reload the leases. Problematic leases will not load correctly, and if the number of such leases exceeds a threshold value, then the server will fail to start. A network-adjacent attacker could therefore cause a DoS by sending maliciously crafted requests to a server that will cause problematic lease records to be added to the store.\n\nIt should be noted that only Kea servers that use `memfile` based lease storage are affected.",
