    "description": "Zephyr is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by sending maliciously crafted network traffic to the vulnerable server.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `mqtt_read_message_chunk()`, which is defined within the file `mqtt_rx.c`, copies data obtained from client input into the RX buffer (`rx_buf`).  The client input is stored within the buffer `buf`, with the quantity of data that remains to be read being stored in the variable `remaining`. The total size of the RX buffer is stored within the variable `rx_buf_size`. \nSome checks are performed to try and ensure that the quantity of data that is copied does not exceed `rx_buf_size`. However, if the quantity of client input data is very large, an integer overflow can occur in the `remaining` variable. This will cause the application to believe that the quantity of data that remains to be read is much smaller than the actual amount. This will cause a buffer overflow to occur, which can raise an exception and halt program execution. A remote attacker could therefore cause a DoS by sending a large quantity of data to a vulnerable server.",
