    "description": "Collabtive is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient validation of client-provided input. A remote attacker could cause the application to include a malicious JavaScript payload in dynamically generated web content by sending maliciously crafted requests to the application. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "Collabtive provides users with an interface that allows them to edit their profile. This functionality is implemented using code contained within the file `manageuser.php`. This contains numerous form fields, one of which is 'Address'. The input fields that constitute this section of the form correspond to numerous fields in the POST request that is generated by the page (`address1`, `zip`, `address2`). The values associated with these form fields are insufficiently sanitized. If one of the values constitutes a XSS payload, then that payload will be executed within the browser of any user who views the attacker's profile information. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
