    "description": "Yara is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the application using a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `macho_parse_file()`, which is defined within `macho.c`, is used by Yara to parse a Mach-O file with a specific bit width and byte order. Such files contain specific commands for the application, which are written to buffers in memory. The size of each command is tracked via the `command_size` variable, the value of which is not validated to ensure that it actually matches the size of the relevant command. The value of `command_size` is used to conduct pointer arithmetic, the outcome of which is used to access the contents of the `data` memory buffer. \n\nIf a maliciously crafted Mach-O file is being processed by the application, `command_size` can be manipulated such that the calculated pointer lies outside the boundaries of `data`. An out-of-bounds memory access will therefore occur, which can raise an exception and halt program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the application with a maliciously crafted Mach-O file as input.",
