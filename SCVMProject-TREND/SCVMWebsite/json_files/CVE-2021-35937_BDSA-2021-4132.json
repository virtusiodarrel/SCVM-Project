    "title": "RPM Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Issue in Symbolic Link Checks",
    "description": "RPM is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue due to a race condition that exists in the checks to ensure that RPM only follows directory symbolic links owned by a target directory owner or root. These flawed checks were implemented in response to the previously reported privilege escalation issues **CVE-2017-7500** (**BDSA-2017-3497**) and **CVE-2017-7501** (**BDSA-2017-3660**).\n\nAn \"unprivileged\" user could attempt to exploit this narrow race window in order to cause the policy to not be enforced and gain root privileges.\n\n**Note**: A Red Hat engineer has stated [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1964125#c5) that in this context, \"unprivileged\" users are system accounts, like `pcpqa` for example, that are usually more tightly controlled than ordinary users. Accessing files and directories installed by RPMs requires high privileges.",
    "technicalDescription": "RPM is vulnerable to privilege escalation because a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition exists between the`lstat()` (finds a safe symbolic link) and `open()` (creates a new file) calls. It could be possible for an attacker to cause the RPM symbolic link policy to not be enforced by changing things during this window.\n\n**Note**: The issue reporter has stated [here](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1157882#c0) that due to the narrow timing window between the calls, exploits are difficult to achieve. However, they referenced a [paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec05/tech/full_papers/borisov/borisov.pdf) and suggested that it may be possible to use mazes to delay the `stat()` long enough for an exploit to be executed.",
