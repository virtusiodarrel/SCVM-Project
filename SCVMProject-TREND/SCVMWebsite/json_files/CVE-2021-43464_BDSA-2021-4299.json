    "title": "Subrion CMS Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Improper Validation of 'Background Fields'",
    "description": "Subrion CMS is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to improper sanitization behind a required fields validation. An authenticated remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying shell by entering specially crafted scripting code via user-supplied input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability exists due to improper validation of the input field `Validation PHP code` which is used to validate required fields within the application. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to input crafted malicious code and use sensitive functions such as `exec()` and `system()`.\n\nTo trigger, the attacker can visit `/profile/?edit` which will then give the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary commands as they will now have access to the shell. Every time information is modified in a vulnerable field containing the `Validation PHP code`, it is executed through the function `eval()` via the `required_checks` field saved in the database which stores the malicious code.",
