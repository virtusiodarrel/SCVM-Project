    "description": "openam contains a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.  Attackers can exploit this by crafting a malicious one-line `GET` or `POST` request to an endpoint. Successful exploitation can result in code execution on the target system as the service user. \n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists within the identity and access management solutions due to deserialization of untrusted data in `jato.pageSession` parameter. This flaw in the Jato framework can be triggered by a simple one-line `GET` or `POST` request to a vulnerable endpoint. Attackers could exploit this by crafting a malicious payload to be input to the applications vulnerable endpoints containing the `<serialized_object>` Java object, this can then added with a null byte and encoded with `base64url`, resulting in RCE condition occurring. The vendor addressed this by removing the`/ccvesion` endpoint, along with other legacy endpoints that use Jato.\n\nNote: This vulnerability does not affect instances running with Java version 9 or newer, since Jato requires classes that have been removed in Java 9.",

On Tomcat, ensure that access rules cannot be bypassed using known path traversal issues: Tomcat path traversal via reverse proxy mapping.`",
