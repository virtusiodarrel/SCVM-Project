    "title": "Pluck CMS Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbittrary File Upload in 'files.php'",
    "description": "Pluck content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) as it does not properly restrict uploads of files with dangerous file types. An attacker with administrator-level credentials could leverage this flaw to upload a web shell and achieve arbitrary code execution on the underlying host.",
    "technicalDescription": "This flaw lies in the file upload functionality in `files.ph` source file. When an uploaded file has one of the extensions black-listed in `$blockedExtentions` it will be renamed to `.{ext}.txt` to stop it from getting executed. As the `.htaccess` extension is not part of that blacklist an attacker could overwrite the contents of the original `.htaccess` file.\n\nThis can be exploited by uploading a `.htaccess` file that specifies `SetHandler x-http-php` for a `.txt` file to abuse the fact that only certain PHP-related extensions are blacklisted. Subsequently the attacker will be able to upload a file with a `.txt` extension which in fact contains a PHP payload.",
