    "title": "Brave Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Logging of v2 Domain Connections",
    "description": "Brave is vulnerable to information exposure due to the unsafe logging of timestamp data for v2 domain connections. An attacker could obtain information on a victim's Tor browsing activities by examining the `tor.log` file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `components/tor/tor_launcher_factory.cc` contains code that is used by Brave to invoke its Tor functionality. One of the tasks that is performed by this code is to create a task runner for creating and maintaining an on-disk log file. This log file is located at `BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/tor/data/tor.log`. Sensitive timestamp information relating to the user's Tor session will be logged to this file. The timestamps that are recorded can be used to identify the precise moment that a user connected to a particular v2 Tor domain. A local attacker that is authorized to view the log file could examine the file in order to obtain sensitive information relating to a victim's Tor browsing habits.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the log data is written to volatile memory instead of to the disk.",
