    "title": "Wireless Protected Access PeerKey Handshake Allows Reinstallation of the Station-To-Station Link Transient Key  [KRACK]",
    "description": "KRACK (Key Re-installation Attack) refers to a collection of vulnerabilities affecting products supporting the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols.  These vulnerabilities arise from design and implementation flaws in the underlying protocol itself.\n\nWPA and WPA2 in multiple products suffer from key re-installation attacks via protocol handshakes which can compromise the data-confidentiality layer.  Once encryption has been compromised, further attacks can be mounted against applications at the network layer.",
    "technicalDescription": "A PeerKey handshake is derived from the 4-Way handshake, and used when 2 clients want to communicate securely with each other. It was proposed in 2005 by Microsoft as a replacement for the STAKey handshake, and later endorsed as a standard in IEEE 802.11-2007.  Researchers should refer to IEEE 802.11-2016 or latest specification available to understand how the handshake works.\n\nThe Access Point (AP) must establish a Robust Security Network Association (RSNA) with each station (STA) prior to PeerKey setup. The initiator STA starts the PeerKey Handshake, at the conclusion of which a key is established to secure the connection.\n\nIt consists of 2 phases.\n\n1.  A Station-To-Station Link (STSL) Master Key (SMK) handshake is performed.  It negotiates a shared master secret between 2 peers.\n2.  A session key is derived from the STSL Transient Key (STK) \n\nThe SMK handshake (phase 1) is unaffected by a key re-installation attack, because the Master Key exchanged between 2 systems isn't used by a data-confidentiality protocol.  There are no nonces or replay counters to reset for this key.\n\nHowever, the STK handshake (phase 2) is used by a data-confidentiality protocol. \n\nTo attack wpa_supplicant, a replay attack of Message 3 in the 4-Way handshake is sufficient to force a remote peer to reinstall a STK.  The attack was only successful against wpa_supplicant by the authors of KRACK, and as a result, an attack against the PeerKey handshake is considered to be of low impact.",
