    "title": "Curl Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Use-After-Free and Double Free in MQTT Sending",
    "description": "Curl is vulnerable to pointer manipulation which could lead to both a use-after-free and a double free vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this could allow an attacker to cause denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists when libcurl sends data to an MQTT server in the `mqtt_send()` function in file `lib/mqtt.c` of Curl. In some cases libcurl will keep a pointer to a memory area which has already been freed, this pointer can subsequently be used again in another call, and also be freed again. This can lead to both a use-after-free and a double free vulnerability.\n\nThe vendor has mitigated against this by ensuring that the pointers are cleared once data is successfully sent.\n\n**Note:** This vulnerability was introduced by [this](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2522903b79) commit in version **7.70.0**, however MQTT support was marked experimental then and not enabled in the build by default until version **7.73.0**.",
