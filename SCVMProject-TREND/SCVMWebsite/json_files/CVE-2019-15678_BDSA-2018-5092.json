    "description": "TightVNC is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by sending maliciously crafted network packets to the application.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `HandleRFBServerMessage()` is defined within the script `rfbproto.c`. This function utilizes a heap memory buffer, which is denoted by the variable `buffer`. This buffer is allocated using the `malloc()` function. The amount of memory to be allocated is calculated dynamically, using the calculation `msg.sct.length+1`. The value of the variable `msg.sct.length` is obtained by evaluating `rfbClientSwap32IfLE(msg.sct.length)`. If the value of `msg.sct.length` is `0xffffffff`, then an overflow will occur whenever one is added to it. The `malloc()` operation will succeed, but will have allocated a buffer that is far to small. If the value of the `msg.type` variable is `rfbServerCutText`, then the function will attempt to write to this buffer by calling `ReadFromRFBServer()`. The number of bytes that it will attempt to write will be the value of `msg.sct.length`. The function will therefore attempt to write beyond the boundaries of `buffer`, causing an exception to be raised. This will halt program execution, causing a DoS. An attacker could trigger this event by providing the application with crafted input that will cause `rfbClientSwap32IfLE(msg.sct.length)` to return a value of `0xffffffff`.",
