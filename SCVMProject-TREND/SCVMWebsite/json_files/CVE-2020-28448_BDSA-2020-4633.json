    "title": "multi-ini Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via Insufficient Input Validation in 'Parser' Class",
    "description": "multi-ini is vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks due to the insufficient validation of user-provided input. A remote attacker could modify the prototypes of objects in memory by sending maliciously crafted requests to a vulnerable endpoint. The exact impact that the attacker can achieve will depend on how the object is used, but can potentially include remote code execution (RCE) and denial-of-service (DoS).\n\nThe fix for this vulnerability was found to be incomplete, resulting in the existence of an additional vulnerability. This was issued the identifier **CVE-2020-28460** (**BDSA-2020-4636**).",
    "technicalDescription": "The `Parser` class, which is defined in the file `src/parser.js`, contains methods that can be used to modify the properties of objects. Such methods include `assignValue()` and `handleSection()`. It is possible for the name of the property that is to be modified, and its new value, to be derived from user input. Insufficient restrictions are imposed on the properties that can be modified. This means that the prototype (`__proto__` property) of an object can be changed. An attacker could leverage this issue to perform prototype pollution attacks.  The exact impact that the attacker can achieve will depend on how the object is used, but can potentially include RCE and DoS.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed via the addition of a check which ensures that the `__proto__` property is not included in the list of properties which are to be modified. This fix was found to be incomplete, resulting in an additional vulnerability that was issued the identifier **CVE-2020-28460** (**BDSA-2020-4636**).",
