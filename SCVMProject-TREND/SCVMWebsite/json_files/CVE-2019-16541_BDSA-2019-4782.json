    "title": "Jenkins Jira Plugin Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Credential Lookup",
    "description": "Jenkins Jira plugin contains a privilege escalation vulnerability. An attacker with Item/Configure permission could exploit this flaw to access and potentially capture system-scoped credentials which were only intended for global configuration.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs in the credential lookup feature in per-folder scoped Jira sites. This feature fails to set the appropriate context allowing a malicious user with Item/Configure permission on the folder to access and potentially capture system-scoped credentials which were only intended for global configuration.\n\nThe issue was addressed by defining the appropriate folder context for the credential lookup feature. \n\n**Note** As a side effect, existing per-folder Jira sites may lose access to already configured System-scoped credentials, as if no credential was specified in the first place.",
