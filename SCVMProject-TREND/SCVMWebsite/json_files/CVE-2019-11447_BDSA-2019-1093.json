    "description": "CuteNews is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the insufficient validation of uploaded files. An attacker with valid user credentials could cause the server to execute arbitrary commands by providing a crafted `.gif` file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The CuteNews dashboard interface allows users to upload an avatar image for their account. This functionality is provided by code contained in the script `dashboard.php`. The application attempts to verify that the file provided by the user is an actual image file. It does this by comparing the MIME type as specified in the file's header against a whitelist of valid image file formats, including `jpg` and `gif`. However, bypassing this check is trivial. If an attacker provides a malicious file that contains malicious code (such as code that will establish a shell), and to which a valid `.gif` image header has been manually added, it will pass the validation procedure. Thus an attacker with valid user credentials can upload crafted files in order to execute arbitrary code on the target server.",
