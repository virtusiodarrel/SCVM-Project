    "description": "libpcap vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper handling of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by attempting to authenticate using maliciously crafted credentials.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `daemon_AuthUserPwd()`, which is defined within the script `daemon.c `, is used by libpcap in order to verify if the password provided by a client is correct. It does this by comparing the hash of the client-provided password to that which is stored by the application. The `crypt()` function is used in order to compute the hash of the client-provided password. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, this function will return a pointer to a string in memory which contains the computed hash. However, under certain conditions, this function can return a value of `NULL`. The program does not attempt to check if this has occurred and will always attempt to dereference the value that is returned. This can lead to a `NULL` pointer dereference event, which will raise an exception and halt program execution. An attacker could therefore potentially cause a victim's instance of the application to crash if they can provide a crafted password that will cause the `crypt()` function to return a NULL value.",
