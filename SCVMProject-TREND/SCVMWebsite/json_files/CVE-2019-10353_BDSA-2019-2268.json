    "title": "Jenkins Vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) via Security Bypass in CSRF Tokens",
    "description": "Jenkins contains a security bypass vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this flaw to launch cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks if they are able to obtain another user's CSRF token.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs because Jenkins CSRF tokens only checks the user authentication and IP addresses. If an attacker was able to obtain a users CSRF token they would be able to launch CSRF attacks as long as the users IP address doesn't change.\n\nThe issue was addressed by adding a token check, that the web session id was created in the same session otherwise the token is invalidated.",
