    "title": "Nextcloud Server Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via WebAuthn Passwordless Authentication",
    "description": "Nextcloud Server is vulnerable to improper authentication due to missing password authentication in the WebAuthn component. An attacker could gain access to a victims account by sneaking up on the victim and using the security hardware mechanism over NFC.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because `userVerification` has not been set, and the UV flag is not checked on the server. This means that while a **FIDO2** key and a PIN are added to a user account the PIN is not actually required to log in. This was mitigated by discouraging the use of WebAuthn user interaction.",
