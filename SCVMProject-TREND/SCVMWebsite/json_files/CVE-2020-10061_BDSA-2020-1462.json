    "title": "Zephyr Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Reachable Assertion due to Invalid Packet Sequence",
    "description": "Zephyr is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to a reachable failure condition. An attacker could cause a vulnerable instance of the application to crash by sending maliciously crafted Bluetooth traffic to that host.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `isr_rx_pdu()`, as defined within `lll_conn.c`, and `isr_rx_conn_pkt()`, as defined within `ctrl.c`, contain code that is used by Zephyr to parse the initial packets in a Bluetooth connection. Such packets contain sequence information. If this sequence information is invalid, an assertion failure can occur later during processing. This will cause the application to crash. An attacker could therefore cause a vulnerable server to crash by sending maliciously crafted Bluetooth traffic to that server.",
