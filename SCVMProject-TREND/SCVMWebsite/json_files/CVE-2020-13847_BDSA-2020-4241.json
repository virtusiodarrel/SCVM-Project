    "title": "Singularity Vulnerable to Malicious SIF Container Execution via Header Fields Signing Flaw",
    "description": "Singularity is vulnerable to malicious SIF container execution due to how the `sign` and `verify` commands do not sign metadata present in the global header or data object descriptors of a SIG file.\n\nAn attacker could use this issue in order to introduce malicious behavior via crafted or compromised SIF containers.",
    "technicalDescription": "Singularity is vulnerable to malicious SIF container execution because containers can still verify in cases where they otherwise should not. A container will still verify successfully if:\n* partition types are changed after signing, e.g. swapping a `PartPrimSys` and `PartOverlay` to modify runtime behavior,\n* the global hash-bang header used for direct execution (e.g. `./image.sif`) is changed to something else (e.g. `rm -fr $HOME`),\n* object data types are re-labelled to change how Singularity uses them. For example, re-labelling `DataSignature` to avoid the object being considered by singularity `verify`, `DataEnvVar` to avoid environment variables being applied, etc.\n* partition types are re-labelled, in addition to the example above to change the primary system partition, change `data partition` to `system partition`, etc.\n* filesystem types are modified, `FsSquash->FsExt3`, causing mount to attempt to mount the wrong type of filesystem.\n* the `UID`/`GID` of the image or its data objects is modified,\n* the creation time of the image or its data objects is modified,\n* the name of data objects is modified,\n* the `UUID` of an image is modified.\n\n**Note**: The `sign`/`verify` functionality applies to SIF images. If you do not use SIF images (i.e. only use sandbox containers), you are not affected.",
