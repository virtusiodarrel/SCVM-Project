    "title": "ShapeShift KeepKey Firmware Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in 'ethereum_extractThorchainData()'",
    "description": "ShapeShift KeepKey firmware contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow attackers to achieve a denial-of-service (DoS) and remote code execution (RCE). An additional impact of this vulnerability can also be information disclosure of both the `BIP39` seed of the device and the cached passphrase of the device.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in the `msg->data_length` field of function `ethereum_extractThorchainData()` function of file `lib/firmware/ethereum.c`. This field takes a user supplied input, which will eventually be parsed into the `swap_data` parameter by the `ethereum_extractThorchainSwapData()` function. However the `msg->data_length` field has a much larger size limit than `swap_data`, which could allow an attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow. This can be controlled by the attacker in order to subsequently achieve a denial-of-service (DoS) as well as remote code execution (RCE) by manipulating the instruction flow of the application.",
