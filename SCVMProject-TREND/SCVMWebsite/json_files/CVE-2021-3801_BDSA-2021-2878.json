    "title": "Prism Vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial-of-Service via Inefficient HTML Comment Parsing",
    "description": "Prism is vulnerable to regular-expression-denial-of-service (ReDoS) due to a poorly-implemented regular expression. A remote attacker could impact the performance of an application, or cause it to crash, by causing it to process a maliciously expression that is contained within an HTML comment.",
    "technicalDescription": "Prism parses HTML comments using regular expressions that are contained in `components/prism-markup.min.js` and `prism.js`. These regular expressions are flawed such that the parsing process will be performed inefficiently. Whenever certain sequences of characters are being parsed in a comment, an excessive amount of resources can be consumed. An attacker could therefore used maliciously crafted HTML comments in order to severely impact the performance of a vulnerable application. It may also be possible for the attacker to cause the application to crash.",
