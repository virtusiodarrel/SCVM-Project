    "description": "Shopware is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the improper handling of file access configuration settings. A remote attacker can access private files which are stored in the cloud, provided they know the hashed URLs which correspond to those files.",
    "technicalDescription": "The script `FilesystemFactory.php` contains code that is used by Shopware to implement file system configuration settings. This includes file visibility, which is tracked within the code by the `$config['visibility']` variable. The visibility can be specified in multiple places, including in the nested `options` array (`$config['config']['options']['visibility']`). The script fails to utilize this nested option correctly when implementing the visibility of files. As a consequence of this, private files which are stored in the cloud can be accessed publicly by an attacker who has knowledge of the correct hashed URL.",
