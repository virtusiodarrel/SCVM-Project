    "title": "Samba SMB1 Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Improper Length Checks of Client Writes to a Share",
    "description": "Samba SMB1 is vulnerable to server memory information leak due to improper length checks of client write operations to a share. The vulnerability can be triggered by not sending enough data to fulfill the write which results in server memory contents being written into a file or printer. The client cannot control the part of server memory that gets leaked.\n\n**Note**: only versions prior to **4.11.0** are vulnerable to this bug by default since SMB1 has been disabled in higher versions. Higher versions are only vulnerable if the administrator has enabled SMB1 in `smb.conf`.",
    "technicalDescription": "There are 2 preconditions needed for the vulnerability to be exploitable:\n* `/etc/smb.conf` needs to have the line `read only =3D no` under the `share name` section\n* `/etc/smb.conf` needs to have `min protocol =3D NT1` under the `global` section\n\nThe vulnerability (out-of-bounds read) can then be triggered by handling the following SMB1 commands:\n* `SMB_COM_WRITE`\n* `SMB_COM_WRITE_AND_CLOSE`\n* `MB_COM_WRITE_AND_UNLOCK`\n\nThe out-of-bounds read occurs in the function `reply_write`, file `source3/smbd/smb1_reply.c` for `SMB_COM_WRITE` and equivalent functions for other commands.",
