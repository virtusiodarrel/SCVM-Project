    "title": "XStream Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Server-Side Request Forgery through Unmarshalling of Specially Crafted Input",
    "description": "Xstream is vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw where it can be tricked into including remote resources when unmarshalling specially crafted input. A remote attacker could learn details about the internal network.",
    "technicalDescription": "On affected versions running on a Java environment below Java 15, and Xstream is not running with the [suggested](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework) white listing approach of the security framework, the class `jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString` can be leveraged in multiple ways to subvert the unmarshalling process of any of the supported formats( eg JSON, XML, etc). One of these ways includes utilizing `javax.activation.URLDataSource` with the `url` parameter to create a server-side request forgery primitive. With this, an attacker could probe the internal network. \n\nThe issue has been resolved by adding `jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString` to the default blacklist.",
