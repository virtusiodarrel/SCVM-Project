    "description": "Proglottis GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) Library is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Go wrapper. This could also lead to potential code execution.",
    "technicalDescription": "The Golang gpgme library is a wrapper to the underlying gpgme C library. The Go wrapper is used during the interaction of container images and GPG signatures. The wrapper however does not mark the data structures or pointers to be kept alive by the Go run time. During the execution of the gpg binary, it is possible for the Golang garbage collector to free the referenced C structures whilst it is still required. \nAfter the gpg binary finishes executing, the gpgme C library is now referencing released memory. This was mitigated by ensuring that the reference C structures are not dellocated while C code are still using them.",
