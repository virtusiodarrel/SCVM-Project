    "title": "Curl Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Improper Cookie Handling for Top Level Domains",
    "description": "Curl is vulnerable to information exposure due to the improper handling of trailing dot characters in domain names. An attacker could potentially leverage this issue in order to obtain cookies that are associated with arbitrary domains.\n\nIt should be noted that curl is only affected by this vulnerability when it has been built without libpsl.",
    "technicalDescription": "If curl has been built without Public Suffix List (PSL) awareness (i.e. without libpsl), then its cookie engine will perform a check that will attempt to prevent cookies being set for requests to Top Level Domains (TLDs). The check is improperly implemented, such that it can be bypassed if the domain name that is being validated contains a trailing dot character. This could cause cookies that are associated with one domain to be leaked to another.",
