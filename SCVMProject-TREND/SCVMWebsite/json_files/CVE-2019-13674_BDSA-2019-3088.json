    "description": "Chromium is vulnerable to content spoofing due to the improper handling of client-provided input. A remote attacker could trick a user into thinking that content has originated from a different source by crafting URI strings using specific characters.",
    "technicalDescription": "The manner in which URI strings appear to users within Chromium is dependent on the URL Formatter component. It is possible for an attacker to produce a crafted URI in which characters are easily confusable with other characters, making it seem as though a resource originates from a  benign source as opposed to a malicious one. Chromium attempts to prevent these kind of spoofing attacks using the IDN Spoof Checker component, which is implemented using code contained within the script `idn_spoof_checker.cc`. This specifies easily-confusable characters that should be detected. The list of easily confusable characters is incomplete, such that certain characters will be undetected and so could be used by an attacker to craft a spoofing URI. An attacker could therefore trick a victim into visiting a malicious resource by tricking them into clicking a crafted URI.",
