    "description": "International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking that victim into opening a maliciously crafted file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `UnicodeString::doAppend()`, which is defined within the file `unistr.cpp`, is used to append one unicode string to another. The length of the final string is stored within the variable `newLength`, which is calculated by adding the variables `oldLength` and `srcLength`. The variable `newLength` is of type `int32_t`. No validation is performed to ensure that the value produced by the aforementioned calculation is smaller than, or equal to, the maximum value that is permitted by this datatype. If it is larger than this maximum value, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to an exception being raised, which will halt program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into opening a maliciously crafted file that will trigger the aforementioned overflow.",
