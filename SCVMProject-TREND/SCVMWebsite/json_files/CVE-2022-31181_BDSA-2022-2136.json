    "title": "PrestaShop Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via 'Smarty Cache' Component",
    "description": "PrestaShop is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) as it is possible to trigger `eval()` calls via the Smarty cache component if an SQL injection vulnerability is present. A remote attacker could leverage this issue in order to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable server.",
    "technicalDescription": "The MySQL \"Smarty cache\" feature is implemented into PrestaShop using code that is contained in the file `classes/Smarty/SmartyCacheResourceMysql.php`. The feature is unsafely implemented, such that an attacker can trigger the evaluation of the `eval()` PHP function if they are able to achieve an SQL injection attack. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
