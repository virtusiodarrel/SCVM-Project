    "title": "Pillow Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Heap-Based Buffer Overflow due to Incorrect Error Checking in 'TiffDecode.c' File",
    "description": "Pillow contains a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability because of improper error code checking in the `TiffDecode.c` file. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability results from a partial fix for `CVE-2020-35654`. The `_decodeStripYCbCr()` function in `src/libImaging/TiffDecode.c` does not properly check for error codes when `YCbCr` files are being decoded. An attacker could use a crafted `YCbCr` file to cause a heap-based buffer overflow which could result in a denial-of-service (DoS).\nThis issue was fixed by correcting the error checking process when the `TIFFRGBAImageGet()` function is being used.\n\n**Note**: Originally, `CVE-2020-35654` was assigned for this issue. It was fixed by [this](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/commit/c8dd1c84220c11f4e9ab12a166c0da91adace94a) commit in [**v8.1.0**](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/releases/tag/8.1.0). However, this fix was insufficient because it still allowed a buffer overflow. Subsequently, `CVE-2021-25289` was assigned and the issue was completely fixed.",
