    "title": "Gradle Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Repository Authentication Redirection Handling",
    "description": "Gradle is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the unsafe handling of redirection events whenever a repository is being contacted. An attacker could obtain authentication information by hosting a malicious repository instance. This vulnerability only exists whenever Gradle is using a repository that requires authentication, and that repository redirects Gradle to another host in a manner that is uncontrolled by the user.",
    "technicalDescription": "Gradle can carry out authentication in order to obtain data from remote custom repositories that require credentials to access. This is done using code that is contained in a variety of classes, such as `AbstractAuthentication`. These classes are used to dynamically construct HTTP requests which contain headers that specify the required credentials. If Gradle receives  a HTTP redirection reponse, it will automatically submit a HTTP request containing the same credential information to the host specified in that response. If an attacker is able to create a fake instance of that host, they will therefore obtain those credentials. This could possibly allow the attacker to impersonate other users and to obtain sensitive information from remote repositories to which they otherwise would not have access.",
