    "description": "iText is contains an out-of-bounds exception. An attacker could exploit this by supplying a crafted PDF file in order to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. \n\n**Note:** The vendor disputes the validity of this vulnerability stating:\n> This is not something we agree with at this point It's not clear what kind of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) we can get.\n> We do confirm that the provided code sample triggers `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in our Java library. We don't see any description of the potential exploitation of this. The fact that the user of the library may not know that this exception can be thrown does not by itself mean that we have a vulnerability in the library and that cannot be associated with Denial of Service vulnerability in our opinion. Java is the programming language that safeguards against buffer overflow attacks and therefore nothing related to information leakage is applicable here.\n> We do agree that the library could have thrown a better exception but the fact that it throws `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is not by itself a vulnerability, and no case supporting that this behavior may be exploited to cause DoS has been presented to us.",
