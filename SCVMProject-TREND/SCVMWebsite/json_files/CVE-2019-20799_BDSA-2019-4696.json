    "description": "Cherokee Web Server is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to multiple memory corruption errors. A remote attacker could exploit these in order to achieve server destabilization.",
    "technicalDescription": "Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities were identified within Cherokee Web Server. The issues are as follows:\n* Remote null pointer dereference trigger in `admin` handler - It is possible to trigger a NULL pointer deference if the request uses a `POST`method with an empty body. This was mitigated by the addition of a check that guards that an empty body is not parsed. \n* Invalid access via `escape_with_table ` - `*s` is used to index the `is_char_escaped` table. Due to `*s`being signed, it is possible to result in a negative value which could allow memory access before `is_char_escaped`. This has been mitigated by now making `*s` unsigned. \n* Heap-based buffer overflow in handler `cgi` - Through fuzzing, a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the `cgi` handler. This was mitigated by the addition of a sanity check which ensures that the header is able to be stored. It also ensures that the `envp` list always ends with NULL, a required terminal. \n* Incorrect use of `ipv6` in proxy connection - A socket structure is incorrectly used as `ipv6` while connecting to a proxy server. This issue occurs because of mixing between `IPv4` and `IPv6` results. If we have an `IPv6` result, but create an `IPv4` socket, it would miss all checks that happen upon socket creation. This was mitigated by moving the iteration over the `getaddrinfo` results in to the proxy specific code.",
