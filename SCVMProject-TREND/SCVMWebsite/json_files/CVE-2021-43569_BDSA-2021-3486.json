    "title": "Stark Bank ecdsa-dotnet Library Vulnerable to User Impersonation via Arbitrary Signature Forgery",
    "description": "Stark Bank ecdsa-dotnet cryptographic library is vulnerable to user impersonation due to the ability for an attacker to forge signatures on arbitrary messages. This can allow an attacker to authenticate as any user and perform operations on the platform, such as send payments and transfer funds. There is also the potential for users and projects to be impacted in different and unforeseen ways.",
    "technicalDescription": "Stark Bank maintains a number of cryptographic libraries that utilize the ECDSA signature verification, this includes the ecdsa-dotnet library. However the implementation used by Stark Bank fails to perform certain checks which are mandated by the standard. This can allow an attacker to supply a signature with a crafted input which will ensure that their signature is not rejected and instead is deemed valid by the code for any message, and under any public key. This can allow an attacker to authenticate as any user and perform operations on the platform, such as send payments and transfer funds.",
