    "title": "OpenEXR Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Divide-By-Zero in 'RGBtoXYZ' Function",
    "description": "OpenEXR is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to a possible divide-by-zero operation. A remote attacker could crash a vulnerable application that uses OpenEXR by causing it to process a malicious crafted EXR file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `RGBtoXYZ()`, of file `src/lib/OpenEXR/ImfChromaticities.cpp`, is used to process EXR color data. Such data can include chromaticity information, which is stored in variables such as `chroma.red.x`. These variables are used in arithmetic operations, some of which involve division. However, the values of these variables are insufficiently validated. It is possible for the value of one or more chromaticity variables to become zero whenever certain EXR files are being processed. This can lead to a divide-by-zero operation. An attacker could use a maliciously crafted EXR file in order to trigger such an operation in order to crash the application and cause a DoS.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by adding additional validation logic to `RGBtoXYZ()` which ensures that values which are to be used in division operations cannot be zero.",
