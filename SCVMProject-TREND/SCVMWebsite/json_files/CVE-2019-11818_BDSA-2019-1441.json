    "description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in OpenCMS. An attacker with the correct privilege level could exploit this vulnerability by distributing a crafted link to execute malicious scripts on the victim's browser.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in OpenCMS which can be manipulated to launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The account management section implements functionality to create new user accounts. The form to create these new accounts located in the URL `/admin/accounts/user_new.jsp` can contain user-supplied input which is not sanitized by the application. It is possible to inject arbitrary code into the `firstname` and `lastname` fields which will be stored and rendered in an application response.\n\nThis functionality is handled in the file `src/org/opencms/ui/apps/user/CmsAccountsApp.java`. An actor must have administrator level privileges to access the user management functionality.",
