    "title": "Linux Kernel Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Page Cache Side-channel Attack",
    "description": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to information disclosure via the system page caches. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to leak sensitive information from the system, or set up a covert communications channel from the target system back to themselves.",
    "technicalDescription": "The local attack uses `mincore` to return a list of which pages are present in memory and which are not. The attackers also implement an efficient method for selectively evicting pages from the page cache. Because the attacker can effectively control which pages are in the cache and which are not, specific pages in the cache can be used as bits and switched on and off (i.e. loaded or unloaded) in order to transfer information across a covert channel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to transmit information covertly between processes running on the same system.  \n\nOther local attacks include a UI redress attack, allowing a local attacker to redraw UI elements such as password entry forms in order to capture sensitive data.  Additionally, keystroke timing attacks, PHP password generation and oracle attacks are also possible with this methodology, and are described in detail in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01161).\n\nThe remote attack depends on having a process running on the target server that is capable of measuring the latency of files accesses in order to determine which pages are in the page cache and which are not. From this the attacker is able to exfiltrate information covertly from a remote system.",
