    "description": "The ansi-html package is vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) issue due to the presence of a flawed regular expression in the `ansiHTML()` function.\n\nAn attacker could submit a crafted input that includes a malicious string in order to cause processing to hang as a result of catastrophic backtracking.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue exists because a regular expression used in the `ansiHTML()` function of the `index.js` file is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking when supplied with a long string of digits. Specifically, the `(\\d+)*` part of the `/\\033\\[(\\d+)*m/g` regular expression is flawed as increasing an input string's length by one character can cause processing to take roughly twice as long.",

The project maintainer was unresponsive at this time, meaning a proposed [pull request](https://github.com/Tjatse/ansi-html/pull/20) was left unactioned. This led community members to publish a forked version that contains fixes for this issue, known as [ansi-html-community](https://github.com/mahdyar/ansi-html-community). **Note**: The maintainer account responded later on **2022-02-28** and merged the proposed changes. See **Solution** for more information.",
