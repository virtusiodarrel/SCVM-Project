    "title": "libcurl Vulnerable to Out-of-Bounds Read via Accessing HTTP/2 Trailers",
    "description": "libcurl is an easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library. It contains an out-of-bounds (*OOB*) read vulnerability within the code handling of HTTP/2 trailers. An attacker could cause a denial of service (*DoS*) attack or leak sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "When accessing a HTTP/2 trailer in libcurl it causes an out-of-bounds read. Since the stored size of an HTTP/2 trailer is one byte less than what is required, reading one trailer can impact future trailers. \n\nThis was due to the change of the appended string from this `:` to `: `. A space had been added after the colon but the associated math to count this space was not updated resulting in an incorrect trailer buffer size.\n\nAn attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (*DoS*) or leak of sensitive information from the buffer. This vulnerability was introduced within this [commit](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0761a51ee0551ad9e5). \n\nThe vendor is not aware of any exploit at this time.",
