    "title": "Chromium Vulnerable to Unspecified Impacts via Use-after-Free in 'Extensions'",
    "description": "Chromium is vulnerable to unspecified impacts via a use-after-free issue in `Extensions`. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a victim with maliciously crafted web content.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `chrome/browser/extensions/extension_uninstall_dialog/*` and `chrome/browser/ui/views/extensions/extension_uninstall_dialog_view.cc` files. If the extension was uninstalled while the dialog box was showing in response to `OnExtensionUninstalled()` or in response to the dialog closing then `ExtensionUninstallDialog` could have called `OnExtensionUninstallDialogClosed()`\ntwice. This may cause lifetime issues as the delegate on which `OnExtensionUninstallDialogClosed()` was called could be deleted after it had been notified of the dialog closing. \n\nIt was mitigated by fixing the duplicate call of `OnExtensionUninstallDialogClosed()`. This was done by closing the dialog programmatically in response to `OnExtensionUninstalled()` which results in `OnDialogClosed()` being called, and the delegate being properly notified, thus ensuring that the `OnExtensionUninstallDialogClosed()` method is only called once.",
