    "title": "Port Processes Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Command Injection in 'index.js' File",
    "description": "Port Processes is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the improper validation of client-provided input. A remote attacker that is able to control the input to the `listProcessesOnPort()` or `killProcess()` functions could leverage this issue in order to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server.",
    "technicalDescription": "The functions `listProcessesOnPort()` and `killProcess()`, of file `index.js`, accept the arguments `port` and `pid` respectively. The value of `port` is supposed to correspond to a port number, whilst the value of `pid` is supposed to correspond to a process ID. The values of these arguments are used to dynamically construct shell commands, which will be executed via the `exec()` function. No validation or sanitization is performed on the value of `port` or `pid` prior to the invocation of `exec()`.\n\nAn attacker could provide a vulnerable instance of the application with maliciously crafted input in order to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying machine. Only instances which pass untrusted input to `listProcessesOnPort()` or `killProcess()` are susceptible to this attack.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed via the addition of logic which ensures that the values passed to `port` and `pid` are numbers.",
