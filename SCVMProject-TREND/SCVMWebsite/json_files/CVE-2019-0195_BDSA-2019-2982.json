    "title": "Apache Tapestry Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via HMAC Key Disclosure through Unauthorized Asset File Download",
    "description": "Apache Tapestry is vulnerable to information disclosure that leads to remote code execution (RCE). An attacker who is able to manipulate the URLs of classpath asset files could download arbitrary files within the classpath. The disclosed information could be used to craft Java deserialization attacks, resulting in arbitrary code injection and RCE.",
    "technicalDescription": "An attacker could download the `AppModule.class` file via a crafted URL, such as `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class`. `AppModule.class` contains a secret HMAC key that is used to sign serialized Java objects. The attacker could then use the HMAC key to craft a Java deserialization attack and inject arbitrary code via a Java gadget chain. The attack could be carried out via the `t:formdata` parameter in the `Form` component.\n\nThe vulnerability was initially thought to be fixed by a adding a blacklist filter that checks if the URL ends with `.class`, `.properties` or `.xml`. However it has been found that the filter can be bypassed by adding a `/` character at the end (`CVE-2021-27850`). The bypass has also been fixed.",
