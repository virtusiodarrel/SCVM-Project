    "description": "Redis is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to incomplete fixes for **CVE-2021-29477**(**BDSA-2021-1226**). It was found that the integer overflow bug that causes **CVE-2021-29477** to occur was fixed on 64-bit systems, but not 32-bit.\n\nAn attacker could execute the `STRALGO LCS` command with crafted input and trigger the integer overflow in order to corrupt the memory heap and potentially execute code.",
    "technicalDescription": "Redis is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) because the `STRALGO LCS` command contains an integer overflow issue due to a lack of sufficient validation. The affected code can be found in `stralgoLCS()` in the `src/t_string.c` file. \n\nThis vulnerability was first reported as **CVE-2021-29477**(**BDSA-2021-1226**), but has also been assigned **CVE-2021-32625** due to incomplete fixes - only 64-bit systems were initially fixed. To address this, the vendor has released a new fix that patches the vulnerability on 32-bit systems as well.",
