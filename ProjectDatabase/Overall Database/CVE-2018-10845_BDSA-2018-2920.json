    "title": "GnuTLS Vulnerable to Lucky Thirteen Style Attack  Due to Low Number of Dummy Compression Calls",
    "description": "A cryptographic timing vulnerability has been discovered in GnuTLS due to a low number of dummy compression function calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a timing side-channel attack with crafted packets to recover plaintext in the TLS algorithm.",
    "technicalDescription": "The GnuTLS implementation of the HMAC-SHA384 signature is vulnerable to a cryptographic timing attack (Lucky Thirteen) via the TLS protocol. This attack uses a timing side-channel attack against the message authenication code (MAC) check stage in the TLS algorithm to break the algorithm in a way which has not been previously mitigated. This is effecting GnuTLS clients and servers which communicates with machines that do not support encrypt-then-mac extension. \n\nIn order to exploit the vulnerability access is required to the CPU cache and an attacker can is able to load random plaintexts to be encrypted (chosen-plaintext attack).  The implementation is at risk because additional blocks processed are restricted to `1` and the additional blocks don't access the plaintext data which may exist at the end of the message. \n\nThe `dummy_wait` function located in file ` lib/cipher.c ` failed to force additional hash compression against peers which do not support SHA256 cipher or a server which only supports SHA384 MAC ciphers.",
