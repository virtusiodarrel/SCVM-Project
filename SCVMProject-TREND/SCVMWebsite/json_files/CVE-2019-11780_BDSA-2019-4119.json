    "title": "Odoo Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Improper Access Control in Computed Fields",
    "description": "Odoo is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to improper access control on the computed fields system.  A malicious user could craft an RPC request to trigger the computation of non-stored fields which could reveal sensitive information and bypass the intended access rights definition.",
    "technicalDescription": "The Odoo framework includes a facility for automatically computing fields which can be cached in the database (stored fields.) Odoo **13.0** changed this functionality so that the fields are computed in super-user mode by default. Previously this needed to be set explicitly in the field declaration. \n\nProper access controls still apply when accessing the field value after computation but non-stored fields might have values that depend on the context of the call that computes them, including the current user and its access level. A remote, authenticated attacker can take advantage of this to access sensitive information via crafted RPC requests, which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n**Note**: this vulnerability was introduced by [this](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/3f555c9068e4c39740e3144782c83d88290cba2c) commit, after the release of **13.0** and prior to the release of **14.0**. Only snapshots of the [development branch](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) from **2019-05-13** to **2019-10-14** are vulnerable.",
