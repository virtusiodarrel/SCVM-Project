    "title": "tcpdump Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service via Heap-Based Buffer Overflow (Read) in Function 'lookup_nsap()'",
    "description": "tcpdump contains a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ISO CLNS` parser. The application reads past the buffer's boundary, reading the adjacent memory which allows an attacker to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or possibly read sensitive in-memory information.",
    "technicalDescription": "tcpdump contains a heap-based buffer overflow (1 byte read) flaw within the function `lookup_nsap()` in file `addrtoname.c`. \n\nThere is an issue with an earlier commit which changed `isonsap_string()` to take, as arguments, a pointer to the first octet of a network service access point (NSAP) and the length of the NSAP. Previously, the arguments were a pointer to a string of octets the first octet of which was the NSAP length and the subsequent octets were the octets of the NSAP.\n\nThe flaw occurs because the function `lookup_nsap()` was not changed, and `isonsap_string()` handed it a pointer to the first octet of the NSAP, which `lookup_nsap()` treated as the NSAP length. This results in the buffer over read into the adjacent memory.\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to potentially gain sensitive information and cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.",
