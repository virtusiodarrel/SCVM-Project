    "title": "Node.js 'json-pointer' Package Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via Array Input to 'set' Function",
    "description": "json-pointer is vulnerable to a prototype pollution issue due to a lack of sufficient input validation in the `set()` function.\n\nAn attacker could abuse this flaw to inject malicious properties into prototypes, which will then be inherited by all objects in that prototype chain. This can potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) or code execution.\n\n**Note**: This issue exists due to an incomplete fix for the previously reported prototype pollution vulnerability **CVE-2020-7709** (**BDSA-2020-4550**).",
    "technicalDescription": "**CVE-2020-7709** (**BDSA-2020-4550**) is a prototype pollution issue reported for json-pointer. A fix for this issue was made available in [**0.6.1**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-pointer/v/0.6.1) by [this](https://github.com/manuelstofer/json-pointer/commit/1dbd1ed6bef76f359dcf44d5b0e849d4881540b2) commit, however, it has now been indicated that this fix is not complete. A bypass for this fix has been reported as **CVE-2021-23820** and exists because the `set()` function in the `index.js` file does not sufficiently validate user supplied input and allows attackers to supply 'point components' in the form of arrays in order to circumvent protection measures and perform prototype pollution attacks.",
