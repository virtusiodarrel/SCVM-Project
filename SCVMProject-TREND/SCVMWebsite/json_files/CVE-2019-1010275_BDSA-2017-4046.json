    "title": "Helm Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via Insufficient Certificate Validation",
    "description": "Helm is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to the insufficient validation of client certificates. A remote attacker could connect to a vulnerable server by presenting a self-signed certificate during the connection negotiation process.",
    "technicalDescription": "Helm contains functionality for validating the certificates that are presented by clients. The validation process does not require a certificate to be signed by a known CA, and will instead allow clients presenting self-signed certificates to connect. An unauthorized attacker could therefore connect to a vulnerable server by presenting that server with a self-signed certificate.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the validation process requires certificates be signed by a known CA.",
