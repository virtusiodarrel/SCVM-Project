    "title": "Mozilla Firefox Vulnerable to Sensitive Information Disclosure via Same-Origin Bypass Using Service Worker",
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox contains a flaw which permits the disclosure of sensitive information due to an insecure action by service workers.",
    "technicalDescription": "A service worker is a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing. In some circumstances, a service worker may use redirection to avoid the tainting of cross-origin resources. \n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious website that will exploit the flaw in service worker redirection to bypass same-origin policy and allow the attacker to read user responses containing confidential, sensitive information.\n\nThis vulnerability is currently embargoed by the maintainer. This means that much of the information necessary to make an accurate assessment of the technical details and the CVSS scoring is private and therefore unavailable. Analysis is based on the best information available at the time of writing and is therefore fully subject to change as further details emerge.\"",
