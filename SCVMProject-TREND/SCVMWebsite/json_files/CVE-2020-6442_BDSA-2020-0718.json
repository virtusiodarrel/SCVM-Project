    "title": "Chromium Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Length-Based Cross-Site Search Attack",
    "description": "Chromium is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the exposure of cross-site responses stored that are stored in a cache. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim into visiting a maliciously crafted webpage.\n\n**NOTE**: From version 67, CORB denies suspicious cross-site requests, therefore an attacker would need to find and exploit a CORB bypass vulnerability in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "technicalDescription": "A padding mechanism exists to prevent cross-site responses stored in caches from leaking information, which prevents the Quota Management API from revealing the response's actual size by adding this generated padding size to the actual size of the response.\n\nIt is possible to bypass this padding mechanism to identify the actual response size of a sensitive request due to how the padding size is calculated. This is because the same URL will get the same padding size, whereas different URLs will receive different padding sizes.\n\nBy reviewing the data in Quota Management API after making an unauthenticated request to a URL and then an authenticated request to the same URL, it is possible to identify the actual size of the authenticated response by subtracting the size of the unauthenticated response from the size of the authenticated response.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability to identify a victim or obtain information about the victim due to the response sizes. The types of URLs that are vulnerable to this type of attack are ones which relate to search interfaces (for example, YouTube watching history). This is due to this vulnerability exploiting a [Cross-Site Search Attack](https://github.com/OWASP/www-pdf-archive/blob/master/AppSecIL2015_Cross-Site-Search-Attacks_HemiLeibowitz.pdf) and relies on identifying quantity of search results from the response length.",
