    "title": "Crypto++ Vulnerable to Timing-Based Side Channel Attack via Scalar Multiplication Functionality",
    "description": "Crypto++ is vulnerable to timing-based side channel attacks due to discrepancies in the length of time taken to multiply certain values. An attacker could recover the private key being used by a cryptographic implementation by measuring the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations conducted by that implementation.",
    "technicalDescription": "The scripts `ecp.cpp` and `algebra.cpp` contain code that is used by Crypto++ in order to implement the ECDSA signature generation process. Part of this code is used to conduct scalar multiplication routines, and to create binary and prime field curves. The execution time of scalar multiplications events is dependent on the state of the system and hence on the private key that is being used i.e. such operations do not occur in constant time. This allows for timing-based side channel attacks to occur, which can allow attackers to obtain sensitive information about the cryptosystem, including the private key that is in use. In order to achieve this, they must be able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations.",
