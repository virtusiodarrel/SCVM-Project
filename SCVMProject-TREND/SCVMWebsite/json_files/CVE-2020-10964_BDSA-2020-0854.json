    "title": "Serendipity Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unrestricted File Upload in Media Library",
    "description": "Serendipity is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE).  This allows an attacker with privileges to access the Media Library component to upload a malicious file that can be used to execute code on a system running Serendipity.  This vulnerability is reported to only affect Windows installations.",
    "technicalDescription": "This RCE vulnerability is due to an issue with the sanitization of uploaded files  in the `serendipity_uploadSecure` function in `include/functions_images.inc.php`.  On Windows based installations, a trailing dot is not stripped from filenames.  This makes it possible to rename the file to have a different file extension.  A remote attacker with permissions to access the Media Library can upload a malicious file, then rename the file to have a restricted extension. This will bypass validation to prevent malicious file types.",
