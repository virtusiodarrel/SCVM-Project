    "title": "OpenBSD Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Flaws in 'S/Key' and 'YubiKey' Authentication Mechanism",
    "description": "OpenBSD is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to the improper restriction of certain file editing operations to the correct users. A local attacker who has obtained the privileges of the `auth` group could gain root privileges by editing a file in the `/etc/skey` directory. It should be noted that this vulnerability can only be exploited whenever S/Key or YubiKey type authentication is enabled; these are disabled by default.",
    "technicalDescription": "The S/Key and YubiKey authentication mechanisms are installed within OpenBSD by default, but are disabled. These mechanisms make use of the `/etc/skey/` and `/var/db/yubikey/` directories, which are intended to contain files with authentication information for particular users. These directories are writable by members of the `auth` group, and so a local attacker who belong to this group could create a file that corresponds to a user that they would like to impersonate, and then use the corresponding authentication mechanism to log in as that user. A local attacker can use this to gain root access to a vulnerable system.",
