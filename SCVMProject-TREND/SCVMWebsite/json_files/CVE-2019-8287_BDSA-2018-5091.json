    "title": "TightVNC Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Buffer Overflow in 'HandleCoRREBPP()' Function",
    "description": "TightVNC is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by sending maliciously crafted network packets to the application.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `HandleCoRREBPP()`, which is defined within `corre.c`, manipulates the memory buffer that is referenced by the `buffer` variable. It does so by calling the function `ReadFromRFBServer()`. The number of bytes to be written to `buffer` will depend on the outcome of the calculation `hdr.nSubrects * (4 + (BPP / 8)`. The value of `hdr.nSubrects` is a 32-bit unsigned integer, which is derived from data contained in network packets that have been received from a client. An attacker could cause the application to crash by sending maliciously crafted packets to the application, which will cause `hdr.nSubrects` to be large enough to cause the application to write to memory addresses that lie outside of the boundaries of `buffer`. This will raise an exception, halting program execution.",
