    "title": "HTCondor Vulnerable to Unauthorized Access to S3 Cloud Storage Files via 'Pre-Signed' URLs",
    "description": "HTCondor is vulnerable to an unauthorized access to private files in S3 cloud storage due to how pre-signed URLs are written to daemon logs and the job ad for jobs that request files to be transferred to or from S3 cloud storage.\n\nAn attacker who can login to a Schedd or Startd machine could obtain pre-signed URLs for all jobs that passed through that machine. An attacker with READ access to the Schedd could obtain pre-signed URLs for any jobs for which S3 transfers failed. The pre-signed URLs could allow the attacker to both read and write data.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because the file transfer functionality defined in `src/condor_utils/file_transfer.cpp` can log pre-signed URLs for jobs that request HTCondor to transfer files to or from S3 cloud storage.\n\nThe daemon logs of the `condor_shadow` or `condor_starter` could then be searched with the command line tools to obtain pre-signed URLs for jobs with an S3 transfer error.",

To do so, the following can be set in the configuration files:\n```\nSIGN_S3_URLS = False\n```\nFor jobs that use file transfer to/from S3 for private data, you must then devise another access path. This can include providing a file transfer plugin that supports the `s3` or `gs` scheme.",
