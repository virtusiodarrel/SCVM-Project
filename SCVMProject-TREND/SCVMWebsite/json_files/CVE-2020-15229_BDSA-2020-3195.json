    "title": "Singularity Vulnerable to File Modification via Insecure Path Handling in 'unsquashfs' Functionality",
    "description": "Singularity is vulnerable to file modification due to the unsafe handling of file paths by a filesystem extraction component. An attacker could overwrite files on a victim's system by tricking them into extracting a maliciously crafted remote filesystem. This could potentially be exploited to obtain sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `unsquashfs` utility within Singularity is used to extract SquashFS filesystems. This functionality is implemented using the `extract()` method, which is defined within `pkg/image/unpacker/squashfs.go`. Insufficient validation has been implemented for the file paths involved in this process. An attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on a victim's system by tricking them into extracting a maliciously crafted filesystem. This could also potentially be exploited to obtain sensitive information.",
