    "title": "BlackCat Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via 'index.php'",
    "description": "BlackCat content management system (CMS) contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to lack of security measure or token. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted link to another user to execute malicious actions on their behalf.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability mainly exists in `upload/backend/login/index.php`. The CSRF token checks for this page can be bypassed by intercepting a request and removing the CSRF token entirely. This could allow a remote attacker to trick a victim into making an unintentional request by making the victim click on a crafted URL.\n\n**Note** This issue was fixed in [this](https://github.com/BlackCatDevelopment/BlackCatCMS/commit/13de6d65b39d94af3db2de934433116093871161) commit in the **release-1.3** branch. But it started causing login problems for users and the `Add page` was not working after the fix commit.\nFor testing purposes, some debug output was added via [this](https://github.com/BlackCatDevelopment/BlackCatCMS/commit/cf162b26db2c94e29afd61f45983eb010a4bddcb) commit in the **release-1.3** branch.\nThe vendor has decided to remove the use of CSRF tokens entirely and start using same-site cookies instead. However, this will be implemented in v1.4.",
