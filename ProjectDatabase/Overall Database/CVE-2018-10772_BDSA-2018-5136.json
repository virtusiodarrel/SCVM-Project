    "description": "Exiv2 is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a maliciously crafted input file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `tEXtToDataBuf()`, which is defined within `pngimage.cpp`, contains a `while` loop that increments the pointer `p` until three `\\n` characters have been encountered within the memory buffer that `p` points to. The `length` variable is used to track the total size of the buffer that `p` points to. The value of `length` is not reduced by the number of bytes that `p` was advanced. This means that whenever the process attempts to read `length` bytes from the memory region pointed to by `p`, it can read data beyond the actual end of the buffer. This out-of-bounds read can lead to an exception occurring, which will halt program execution. An attacker could cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the program using a crafted input file that will trigger this out-of-bounds read.",
