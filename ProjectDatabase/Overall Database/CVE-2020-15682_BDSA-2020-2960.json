    "title": "Mozilla Firefox Vulnerable to Content Spoofing via External Protocol Prompt",
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to content spoofing via a prompt relating to external protocols. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim into interacting with a prompt from a spoofed origin.",
    "technicalDescription": "Upon clicking a link to an external protocol, a prompt was presented in order to allow the user to choose which application was used to open it in. An attacker could exploit this by inducing a prompt to be associated with a spoofed origin. This issue was mitigated by changing to a tab-modal system and also by ensuring that these could not be improperly associated with an alternative origin.",
