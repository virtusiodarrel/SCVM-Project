    "title": "GnuTLS Vulnerable to Padding Oracle Attack via Leaky PKCS #1 v1.5 Verification",
    "description": "Novel techniques have been discovered that cause GnuTLS to be vulnerable to Bleichenbacher style side-channel attacks, which could allow for the decryption of private data or the downgrade of TLS connections.  The attacker must be able to run processes on the same physical core as the victim.",
    "technicalDescription": "PKCS #1 v1.5 verification in GnuTLS leaks information via side-channels that could be used to recover the contents of RSA encrypted messages or downgrade TLS connections to the target server.  The attacker must be able to run processes on the same physical core as the victim process.\n\nDuring cryptographic operations, any operation that is not constant time (i.e. it takes the same amount of time regardless of the operands) has the potential to leak information.  This includes conditional branching and value comparisons.  The `proc_rsa_client_ks` function in `lib/auth/rsa.c` in GnuTLS performs comparisons and memory operations that are not in constant time and therefore have the potential to leak key material.  Further problems were also discovered in the underlying decryption algorithm from the Nettle library which is also used in GnuTLS.\n\nThe side-channel analysis necessary for a successful padding oracle attack against GnuTLS was demonstrated  by Ronen et al in 'The 9 Lives of Bleichenbacher's CAT: New Cache ATtacks \\[sic\\] on TLS Implementations'.  By applying novel techniques, researchers discovered several different types of padding oracle within GnuTLS.  These were subsequently fixed by ensuring that constant time implementations of all critical operations were used.",
