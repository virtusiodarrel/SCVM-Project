    "title": "BIND Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Reachable Assertion in EDNS Client Subnet Feature",
    "description": "BIND is vulnerable to denial-of-service due to the possibility of triggering a built-in failure state. A remote attacker could cause the application to crash by causing a server to submit a crafted request. It should be noted that this issue only effects Supported Preview Edition releases.",
    "technicalDescription": "EDNS ECS features can be enabled in BIND to assist with the recursive resolution process. The code that is used to deliver this functionality contains assertions as a defensive coding measure. These are intended to detect states which should not occur. Whenever RRSIG records containing data that is malformed in a certain way are received by the application, the state of the application will be such that one of these assertions can be triggered. This will halt program execution.\n\nA remote attacker could therefore cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by causing a vulnerable server to submit a recursive resolution request, the response to which will be a RRSIG record that contains the aforementioned malformed data. It should be noted that this issue only effects Supported Preview Edition releases, and a server must have the recursive ECS feature enabled for it to be vulnerable.",
