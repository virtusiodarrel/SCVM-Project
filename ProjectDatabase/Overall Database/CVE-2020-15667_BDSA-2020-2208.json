    "description": "Firefox is vulnerable to memory corruption due to a heap-based buffer overflow when processing a `MAR` update file. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into processing such a file that has been maliciously crafted. It has been reported that this could potentially lead to remote code execution, however this has not been demonstrated.\n\n**Note:** This issue is only exploitable with the Mozilla-controlled signing key.",
    "technicalDescription": "While processing a `MAR` update file an invalid name length could cause a heap-based buffer overflow. This could lead to an exception being raised which will halt program execution. An attacker could exploit this to cause a DoS; they could achieve this by tricking a victim into opening a maliciously crafted `MAR` file. It has been reported that this could potentially lead to remote code execution, however this has not been demonstrated.",
