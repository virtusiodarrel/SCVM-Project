    "description": "axTLS is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause the application to become unresponsive using  a maliciously crafted TLS certificate handshake message.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `asn1_get_printable_str()` is used in the processing of X.509 certificates. This function calls `get_asn1_length()` in order to get the length of the certificate. The return value of this function is stored in the `len` variable. The `malloc()` function is subsequently called in order to allocate memory on the heap. The quantity of memory to allocate is derived from the value of `len`. This value is not validated prior to the call to `malloc()`. This could lead to an excessively large memory allocation. The system will later attempt to write to the allocated memory. A remote attacker could provide a maliciously crafted certificates to a vulnerable server in order to trigger the aforementioned events, which could lead to a significant impact on the system's performance and could potentially cause a DoS.",
