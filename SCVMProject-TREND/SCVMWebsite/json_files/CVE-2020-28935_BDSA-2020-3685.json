    "description": "NLnet Labs Unbound and NSD are vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion and denial-of-service (DoS) via local symlink attack via writing to `PID` file. An attacker could exploit this by gaining access to the user the application is running as.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because when a `PID` file is written it will create a new file, or it will open the existing file for writing. In the case of the latter it fails to check whether the existing file is a symlink before opening. If it were a symlink then a `chown` of the file would take place after it was written which would result in the application user becoming the owner of the file. A local attacker could exploit this by creating a symlink in place of an existing `PID` file and then using it to point to a file that they want to erase. In the event that the application process is killed without the `PID` file being cleared, if it is restarted with root privileges then any file pointed at by the symlink will be rewritten. This could cause a subsequent denial-of-service condition. \n\nIt was mitigated by ensuring that symlinks cannot interfere with `chown` with regard to `PID` files. These fixes were applied in the `readpid` function which is present in the `nsd.c` file within NSD and the `daemon/unbound.c` file within Unbound.",
