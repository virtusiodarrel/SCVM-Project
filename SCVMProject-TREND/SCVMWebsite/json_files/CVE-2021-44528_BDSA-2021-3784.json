    "title": "ActionPack Vulnerable to Open Redirects via Invalid Domain Characters in  'X-Forwarded-Host' Header",
    "description": "ActionPack (part of Ruby on Rails) is vulnerable to open redirects via `X-Forwarded-Host` headers. Specially crafted `X-Forwarded-Host` headers in combination with certain `allowed host` formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in ActionPack to redirect users to a malicious website.\n\n**Note:** the vulnerability impacts applications that have allowed hosts with a leading dot in the configuration file, for example `.EXAMPLE.com`.",
    "technicalDescription": "If the value of `X-Forwarded-Host` is prefixed with an invalid domain character (such as `/`), it will be accepted as the actual host of that request. This allows attackers to change generated links and thus redirect to their malicious websites.",
