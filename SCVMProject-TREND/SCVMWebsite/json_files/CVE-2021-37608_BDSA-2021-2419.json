    "title": "Apache OfBiz Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbitrary File Upload in Image Management",
    "description": "Apache OfBiz is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to missing sanitization for uploaded files. An authenticated attacker could upload a malicious file that would allow them to execute arbitrary OS commands on the host.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability is caused due to a missing file extension check for files submitted via the `catalog/control/UploadCategoryImage?productCategoryId=CATALOG1_BEST_SELL&pload_file_type=category` URI. Initially this issue was not assigned a CVE because this is a post-auth RCE. However, **CVE-2021-37608** was assigned after it was noticed that the uploaded file check was being performed incorrectly in the Image Management component.\n\n**Note:** it was found that the initial fix to the vulnerability was incomplete and that the fix commit [8d49af4](https://github.com/apache/ofbiz-framework/commit/8d49af4) could be bypassed. The [OFBIZ-12307](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12307) JIRA ticket shows that an insufficient filename validation in the `isValidFile()` function (in the file `framework/security/src/main/java/org/apache/ofbiz/security/SecuredUpload.java`) does not delete a malicious file named `xx.png.jsp`. New fix commits have been released to address this issue.",
