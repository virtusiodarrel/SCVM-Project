    "title": "Kubernetes Multitenant Clusters Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks via 'LoadBalancer' or 'ExternalIP' Functionality",
    "description": "Kubernetes Multitenant Clusters are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks via `LoadBalancer` or `ExternalIP` functionality. An attacker with `create` or `edit ` pods or services may be able to exploit this issue in order to intercept traffic from other nodes or pods in the cluster.",
    "technicalDescription": "An attacker who can create `ClusterIP` services and set the `spec.externalIP`s field will have the ability to intercept the traffic going to that IP address. In addition an attacker with the ability to patch the status of a `LoadBalancer` service can set the `status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip` to achieve a similar outcome. Setting of a `LoadBalancer` service is normally a privileged operation which standard users should not be granted the ability to carry out. This issue is described by the vendor as a \"design flaw that cannot be mitigated without user-facing changes.",

There is no patch for this issue, and it can currently only be mitigated by restricting access to the vulnerable features.\n> \n> To restrict the use of external IPs we are providing an admission webhook container: k8s.gcr.io/multitenancy/externalip-webhook:v1.0.0. The source code and deployment instructions are published at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/externalip-webhook.\n> \n> Alternatively, external IPs can be restricted using OPA Gatekeeper. A sample ConstraintTemplate and Constraint can be found here: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library/tree/master/library/general/externalip.\n> \n> No mitigations are provided for LoadBalancer IPs since we do not recommend granting users patch service/status permission. If LoadBalancer IP restrictions are required, the approach for the external IP mitigations can be copied.",
