    "title": "Nextcloud Desktop Client Vulnerable to Insecure End-to-end Encryption via Missing Public Key Verification",
    "description": "The Desktop Client for Nextcloud is vulnerable to insecure end-to-end encryption due to missing a step during public certificate verification. The client does not check if a private key sent by a Nextcloud instance belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. This means a malicious public key served by the Nextcloud instance would allow data encrypted using this key to be visible to the attacker.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to verify the public key against the private key in the `src/libsync/clientsideencryption.cpp` file within the function `ClientSideEncryption::checkPublicKeyValidity()`.",
