    "title": "OpenBSD Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Memory Allocation Failure in '_dl_setup_env()' Function",
    "description": "OpenBSD is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a failure to implement a security feature whenever insufficient system memory resources are available. A local attacker could execute code with root privileges by manipulating certain system quantities.",
    "technicalDescription": "OpenBSD contains a security feature that tries to prevent privilege escalation from occurring via shared libraries. This feature causes SUID binaries to be executed with the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environmental variable being set to a safe value, so that attacker-controlled code is not loaded into the privileged execution environment. This security feature is implemented using code contained within the function `_dl_setup_env()`, which is defined within `ld.so`. This ends up calling `_dl_reallocarray()` in order to allocate memory that will hold the sanitized library path. However, if `RLIMIT_DATA` is set to a low value, the call to `_dl_reallocarray()` will fail. This will allow an unsanitized `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable to be set, and could allow a local attacker to load malicious code into the process and have it executed with root privileges.",
