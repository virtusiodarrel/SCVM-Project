    "title": "Pillow Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Insufficient Restrictions on 'builtins' Functionality",
    "description": "Pillow is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the insufficient validation of input which is passed to the `eval()` method. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system by causing a vulnerable endpoint to process maliciously crafted input. It should be noted that the impact that the attacker can achieve will depend on the configuration of the 'builtins' component.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `eval()` method, of file `src/PIL/ImageMath.py`, is used by Pillow to evaluate image expressions. The `builtins.eval()` method is invoked inside `eval()` in order to achieve this. If an attacker can control the expression that is passed to `builtins.eval()`, then they could potentially leverage a maliciously crafted expression in order to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system. The vulnerability was fixed via the addition of logic which ensures that only a restricted subset of 'builtins' functionality can be invoked.",
