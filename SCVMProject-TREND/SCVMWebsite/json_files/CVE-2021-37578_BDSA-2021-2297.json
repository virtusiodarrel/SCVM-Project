    "title": "Apache jUDDI Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unsafe Deserialisation of Java Objects",
    "description": "Apache jUDDI is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to unsafe deserialization of Java objects. An attacker could provide jUDDI with a crafted serialized object which when deserialized could let an attacker run arbitrary code.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue is due to the default Java serialization mechanism used by Java's Remote Method Invocation included in UDDI. Due to this mechanism not performing checks on the data being deserialized an attacker is able to provide jUDDI with a crafted serialized object which will execute arbitrary code when deserialized.\n\nThis issue was fixed by removing all code which is related to RMI.",

The workaround states that the following steps can be used in order to mitigate this vulnerability:\n\n> jUDDI Clients, disable RMITransports (found in uddi.xml) and use alternate transports such as HTTPS.\n> jUDDI Server (juddiv3.war/WEB-INF/classes/juddiv3.xml), disable JNDI and RMI settings in `juddiv3.xml`.\n> The appropriate settings are located below in xpath style notation.\n* `juddi/jndi/registration=false`\n* `juddi/rmi/registration=false`\n\n> If the settings are not present, then JNDI and RMI are already disabled. This is the default setting.",
