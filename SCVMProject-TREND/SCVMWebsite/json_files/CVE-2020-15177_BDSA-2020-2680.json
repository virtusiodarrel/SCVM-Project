    "title": "GLPI Vulnerable to Open Redirection and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via`install/install.php` endpoint",
    "description": "GLPI is vulnerable to open redirection and  stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insecure storage of user input. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit these to trick a user into redirecting to an attacker-controlled site or include malicious scripts, that when executed within the browser, can result in the theft of authentication tokens, user cookies or other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `checkConfigFile` function of the `install/install.php` file. This file insecurely stores user supplied input into the database as `url_base` and `url_base_api`. These are then referenced throughout the application. An unauthenticated attacker could point these fields at a malicious website or form input in order to execute a cross-site scripting attack. This was mitigated by the addition of validation checks to ensure that the database configuration file does not exist and that `url_base` and `url_base_api` are not used outside the installation process.",
