    "description": "The Sleuth Kit is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted `.iso` file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `parse_susp()`, which is defined within the script `iso9660.c`, is used by The Sleuth Kit for parsing System Use Sharing Protocol (SUSP) data. Such data can contain SUSP Extension Registration (ER) entries. The program will attempt to use the `memcpy()` function to copy the strings contained in the ER entries into an in-memory buffer. The strings are stored in the `er` structure, whilst the buffer is denoted by the `buf` variable. The buffer denoted by `buf` has a hard-coded size of 258 bytes. The amount of data that will be copied via `memcpy()` is obtained from the ER entry data, specifically from the `len_des` component of the `er` structure. No validation is performed on the value of this variable. As a result of this, a crafted ER entry can be used to cause the program to write past the boundaries of `buf`. This buffer overwrite event can cause an exception to be raised, halting program execution. \n\nAn attacker could therefore cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a malicious `.iso` file as input, which contains crafted ER entries.",
