    "title": "Netty Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling via Obfuscated HTTP Request Headers",
    "description": "Netty is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling due to the improper handling of HTTP requests that possess certain properties. An attacker could cause the back-end to misinterpret the contents of HTTP requests made by clients by supplying their own malicious requests in which the HTTP header fields have been maliciously crafted.",
    "technicalDescription": "The code contained within the `HttpObjectDecoder` class is used by Netty to parse HTTP requests that have been received from clients. This class contains a method, `splitHeader()`, that is used to decode the header fields that are contained in a HTTP request. The expected format of a HTTP header string consists of the title of the header followed immediately by a colon. If there is whitespace between the header title and this colon, Netty may not parse the remainder of the header correctly such that the location where the request terminates may not be interpreted correctly. This could allow an attacker to obfuscate the `Transfer-Encoding` header. This means that if another client's request is subsequently received by the application, the tail of the previous request may be considered a part of the new request. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms, or to deliver unexpected content to other application users.",
