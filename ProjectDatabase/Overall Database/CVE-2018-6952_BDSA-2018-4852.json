    "title": "Patch Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Double Free in 'another_hunk()' Function",
    "description": "Patch is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `another_hunk()`, which is defined in `pch.c`, executes the `free()` function against a section of memory that is pointed to by the value located at `p_line[p_end]`. This operation should only be performed whenever the condition `p_end ==  p_efake` is not fulfilled. The value of `p_efake` is swapped with that of `p_bfake` within the function `pch_swap()`.  A second swap then restores the original values. However, the presence of a blank line within a section of text that is being processed will cause a failure in restoring these values. This will lead to a situation where `p_end != p_efake` but in which `p_line[p_end]` points to an already free section of memory. The `another_hunk()` function will therefore perform a double-free operation, which will raise an exception and halt program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the program with a crafted file as input, which will trigger the aforementioned chain of events.",
