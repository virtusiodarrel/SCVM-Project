    "title": "fluture-node Vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure via 'followRedirects' and 'followRedirectsWith'",
    "description": "fluture-node is vulnerable to sensitive information exposure due to the forwarding of confidential headers to third parties. This can allow an attacker access to private personal information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists when using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies included in fluture-node, which is paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as `Authorization` or `Cookie`. If this request was redirected to a third-party over unencrypted HTTP, then the sensitive headers would still be included in the request, and therefore exposed to the third-party. This can allow an attacker access to private personal information.\n\nThe vendor has mitigated against this by automatically redacting confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin.",
