    "description": "The Sleuth Kit is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted hash table.",
    "technicalDescription": "The variable `buf`, which is used within the script `hfind.cpp`, denotes a memory buffer that is used to store the first line of a user-specified hash table. The contents of the hash table is written into `buf` using the `fgets()` function. If the first character of the hash table is a null byte, then the buffer denoted by `buf` will be empty. The application expects the final character in the buffer to be a newline character. It will attempt to remove this character  by accessing the buffer using a dynamically calculated index. This index is calculated as  `strlen(buf) - 1`. If `buf` is empty, then this calculation will return a value of -1. The application will then attempt to write to the memory location that corresponds to `buf[ -1 ]`. This will lie outside the boundaries of the buffer, and so this constitutes an out-of-bounds memory access operation. This can cause an exception to be raised, halting program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the program using a crafted hash table as input, in which the first character is a null byte.",
