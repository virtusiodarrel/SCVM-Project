    "title": "codecov-node Vulnerable to Command Injection via Unsanitized User Input to Upload Method",
    "description": "codecov-node is vulnerable to processing unsanitized user input as part of an executable call. A remote attacker able to supply specially crafted input to an application using codecov-node as a library, could cause the execution of arbitrary system commands. Note that the scenario for this to be exploitable is rare.",
    "technicalDescription": "CVE-2020-7597 had been issued for a similar vulnerability, but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked `&` shell escape characters. Backtick characters could still be used to bypass the sanitization.\n\nThe issue has been resolved by switching the executable function to `execFileSync` which does not suffer from the shell metacharacter escape issue, unless the `shell` option is specified.",
