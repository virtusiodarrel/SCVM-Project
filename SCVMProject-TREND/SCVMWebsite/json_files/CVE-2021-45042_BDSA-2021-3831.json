    "title": "HashiCorp Vault Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Improper Key Size Handling",
    "description": "HashiCorp Vault is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper handling of keys with invalid sizes. A remote authenticated attacker who is authorized to write to the KV secrets engine could cause a vulnerable server to crash by storing a key that is larger than 32KB.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `Transaction()` method, of file `physical/raft/raft.go`, can be used to store keys in the KV secrets engine back-end database. Such keys, which are stored within the `txn.Entry.Key` variable, are not supposed to be larger than 32KB. The `Transaction()` method performs insufficient validation on the length of `txn.Entry.Key` to ensure that it does not exceed this limit. A remote authenticated attacker with permission to write to the KV secrets engine could cause a denial-of-service by attempting to store a key that is too large. This will trigger a panic. \n\nThe vulnerability was fixed via the addition of validation logic which rejects keys that are larger than 32KB.",
