    "title": "Webmin Vulnerable to Remote Command Execution via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) through File Manager Feature",
    "description": "Webmin contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to a lack of security measures or tokens. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted file to another user in order to open a reverse shell for executing malicious code.\n\n**Note:** this vulnerability only affects Webmin instances that were set up using the Perl installation script, which is mainly used on Windows systems. Although the Perl installation script is also available to Linux users, it is not used by default during regular installation procedures.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability exists due to the CSRF protection setting `referers_none` not being enabled if Perl-based (`setup.pl`) installation is used. This causes CSRF to be disabled site-wide, meaning multiple admin endpoints can be targeted to achieve remote code execution (RCE).\n\nTo exploit this particular vulnerability (`CVE-2021-32162`), the attacker has to use the `filemin/http_download.cgi` endpoint. The exploit code uses this endpoint to submit a form that contains a malicious link to open a reverse shell. This link will be passed to the server using a hidden input field during form submission. Subsequently, the link will be available at the following path: `/var/www/html/Mesh3l_Z0ldyck/webshell.php`.\nTo actually exploit this vulnerability, the attacker can generate a file that will create the malicious link. Then, the attacker can trick a victim into accessing this crafted file. Once the victim accesses the file, the attacker can then obtain the command shell at `/var/www/html/Mesh3l_Z0ldyck/webshell.php`. Through the command shell, the attacker can execute malicious commands.\n\nThe issue was fixed by adding a statement in `setup.pl` that sets `referers_none=1` in the config file.",
