    "description": "Contiki and Contiki-NG are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause the application to crash by generating maliciously crafted network traffic.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `sicslowpan.c` contains a variety of functions that are used for reassembling fragmented 6LoWPAN packets. These include `store_fragment()`, `add_fragment()` and `copy_frags2uip()`. The variable `frag_context` is used to track fragments within a fragmentation context. The `uipbuf` buffer is used by the application to store packets that have been reassembled from fragments. Although sanity checks are performed within the `input()` function to ensure that individual packets are not too large, the program neglects to empty the fragment context whenever the fragment offset for a particular packet is too large. This can lead to an overflow in `uipbuf` whenever the fragmented packet is reassembled. An exception can occur as a result of this, halting program execution. A remote attacker could therefore cause a DoS by generating maliciously crafted network traffic with a large fragment offset.",
