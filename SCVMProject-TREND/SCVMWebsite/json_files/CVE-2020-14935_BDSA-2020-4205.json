    "title": "Contiki-NG Vulnerable to Memory Corruption via Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in SNMP Bulk GET Request Processing",
    "description": "Contiki-NG is vulnerable to memory corruption issues due to a lack of sufficient input validation when processing OIDs present in an SNMP request.\n\nThis flaw could allow an attacker to submit a crafted request in order to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow of the `varbinds` buffer. This could affect stability or result in code execution issues.",
    "technicalDescription": "Contiki-NG is vulnerable to memory corruption because the number of OIDs present in an SNMP request is insufficiently validated. When a request is processed with a number of OIDs larger than that which is supported by the engine, a stack-based buffer overflow can occur.\n\nThe affected buffer is `varbinds`. This buffer is written to in the `snmp_message_decode()` function in the `os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c` file without checking the buffer capacity. This allows a request that exceeds the buffer capacity to write to stack memory beyond the allocated OID buffer.",
