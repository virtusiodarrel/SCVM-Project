    "title": "Backdrop Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Improper Archive Validation",
    "description": "Backdrop content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the improper validation of configuration archives. A remote attacker with the `Synchronize, import, and export configuration` permission could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server by uploading a maliciously crafted archive. A server-side scripting language which is not PHP must be available on the vulnerable server if the attack is to succeed.",
    "technicalDescription": "Backdrop CMS allows administrative users with the `Synchronize, import, and export configuration` permission to import configuration archives. Files which are uploaded in this manner are insufficiently validated, such that a remote attacker with the required privileges could upload scripts that contain malicious code which can then be executed. A scripting language that is not PHP must be available on the vulnerable server in order for such an attack to succeed, as Backdrop CMS implements measures to prevent the execution of malicious PHP files.",
