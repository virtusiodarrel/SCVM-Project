    "description": "HHVM is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause the application to crash by providing crafted input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `string_rfind()`, which is defined within `zend-string.cpp`, accepts a number of arguments. Two of these arguments are pointers to strings, one of which is stored in the `input` variable and the other of which is stored in the `s` variable. Two functions, `bstrrstr()`  and `bstrrcasestr()`, may end up being called by `string_rfind()`. \n\nThe function `bstrrstr()` attempts to perform a case sensitive search for the string pointed to by `s` within the string `input`. The function `bstrrcasestr()` functions in a manner that is almost identical to `bstrrstr()`, except a case-insensitive string search is performed. The second argument that is accepted by these functions is intended to denote the length of the string pointed to by `input`, and is used to ensure that only memory contained within the boundaries of the string buffer is accessed. This length is dynamically calculated via the sum `len + pos + s_len`. The result of this calculation is not validated. As these variables can be influenced by client-provided input, it is possible for an attacker to provide crafted data to the application that will result in a value that is too large. This will cause `bstrrstr()` or `bstrrcasestr()` to attempt to access a memory location outside of the intended buffer, which can generate an exception. This will halt program execution. \n\nAn attacker could therefore cause a DoS by suppling crafted input that will trigger the erroneous calculation.",
