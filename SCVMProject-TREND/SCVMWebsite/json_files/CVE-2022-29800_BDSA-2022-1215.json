    "title": "networkd-dispatcher Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Race Condition in Script Handling Component",
    "description": "networkd-dispatcher is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a race condition that exists during the period of time in which scripts are discovered and then executed. A local attacker could elevate their privileges to that of the root user by leveraging maliciously crafted symlinks.",
    "technicalDescription": "networkd-dispatcher builds lists of scripts that are to be executed using the `get_scripts_list()` function, of file `networkd-dispatcher`. These scripts will run with root privileges. The list of discovered scripts is then sorted and executed via the `subprocess.Popen()` method. There exists a race window during the period of time in which the scripts are discovered, sorted, and executed. This race window, combined with the fact that `get_script_list()` and `subprocess.Popen()` will follow symbolic links, could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution as root by creating maliciously crafted symlinks that point to attacker-controlled scripts.",
