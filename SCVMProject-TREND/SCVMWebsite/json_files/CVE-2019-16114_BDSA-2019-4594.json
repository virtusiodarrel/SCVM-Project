    "title": "ATutor Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Insufficient Access Control in 'header.php' File",
    "description": "ATutor contains a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability because of an improper access control mechanism. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious file to the server.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in `install/include/header.php` and then propagates to `install/include/step5.php`. `install/include/step5.php` contains the code for creating a database connection which includes things like database hostname, username, password, port number and the content directory `content_dir` (which contains the files uploaded on the database server).\n\n`install/include/header.php` improperly implements access control by failing to restrict changes to the database connection variables in `install/include/step5.php`. The IF condition (line 18) in `install/include/header.php` only controls access for the first 3 steps of the installation process instead of all the steps.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious request and replacing the database connection variables (`db_host`,`db_port`,`db_login`,`db_password`) with the credentials to his own database. Thus, the application will establish a connection with the attacker's database. This will allow the attacker to log in to the application using credentials from his own database. Next, the attacker will point `content_dir` to a location which suits him. This will allow him to upload a PHP backdoor program, which will subsequently lead to remote code execution.",
