    "description": "GhostScript is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause an instance of the application to crash by causing it to process a maliciously crafted PDF file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `pcx_write_rle()`, which is defined within the file `devices/gdevpcx.c`, is used to copy data to a file. The variable `from` is a pointer into a buffer that contains the data to be copied. The variable `end` is a pointer to the end of this buffer. The copying is performed via a loop that increases `from` as data is copied. The function contains a conditional statement that halts the copying operation whenever `from == end`. However, it is possible for `from` to obtain a value that is greater than `end`, without having obtained a value that is equal to `end` first. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read, which will raise an exception and halt program execution. A remote attacker could therefore cause a DoS by supplying a vulnerable server with a maliciously crafted PDF file that will trigger this chain of events.",
