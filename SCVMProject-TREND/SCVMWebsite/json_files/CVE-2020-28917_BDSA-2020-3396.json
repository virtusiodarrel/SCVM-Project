    "title": "View Frontend Statistics Extension for TYPO3 Vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure via Inappropriate Storage of Sensitive Information",
    "description": "View Frontend Statistics Extension for TYPO3 is vulnerable to sensitive data exposure because sensitive data is saved to the backend database. This could allow an attacker to gain access to this data and compromise the system further.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability only affects users who have the `View Frontend Statistics` Extension extension installed with TYPO3. This extension stores saves all the data received from the GET/POST requests arriving at the TYPO3 frontend into the backend database. This data might include sensitive information like plaintext passwords when other extensions such as `felogin` are installed as well. An attacker with access to this database might gain access to this information.\n\n**Note** This vulnerability only affects the `View Frontend Statistics` extension and not TYPO3 itself. All versions up to v2.0.0 are vulnerable. It is recommended to upgrade to v2.0.1 which is available [here](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/view_statistics/).",
