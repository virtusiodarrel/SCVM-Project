    "title": "Tor Daemon Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Enumeration Attack",
    "description": "Tor contains an information disclosure vulnerability that can be used to isolate a Tor service's IP guard.   This can be used by a remote attacker to obtain information that is needed to perform further attacks against a Tor service.\n\n**Note:** The vendor has stated that this is intended functionality and classed this as not a vulnerability.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability is due to how the Tor daemon connects to a rendezvous node without checking if it exists in the cache (`.tor/cached-microdescs*`).  When Tor protocol is used, typically a Tor circuit is generated that consists of a guard node, a Tor node, followed by a rendezvous node.  This rendezvous node is what a client will \"know\" to send packets to.  A remote attacker can continually map this node and through process of elimination, discover a Tor services guard node.  \n\nIf a remote attacker knowns a Tor services guard node, they can perform a denial-of-service (DoS) against the guard which in turn will cause the service to select a new guard node.  This can be repeatedly performed to cause the service to connect to a rouge guard.",
