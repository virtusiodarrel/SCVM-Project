    "title": "osCommerce2 Vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'tep_db_error' Function",
    "description": "osCommerce2 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue due to a lack of sufficient user-controlled input sanitization.\n\nAn attacker could trick a victim user into submitting a crafted query that could execute scripts in the context of the victim user's browser when a query error is returned.\n\n**Note**: osCommerce2 is no longer supported, and as such is unlikely to receive an official fix for this issue. See **Workaround** for more information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because the `tep_db_query()` function passes the user controlled `$query` parameter to the `tep_db_error()` function to handle MySQL errors. `tep_db_error()` then calls `die()` to display the error, however, the input `$query` is unsafely displayed and can allow for the execution of malicious scripts in the browser.",
