    "title": "LibPNG Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service via 'png_free_data' Function",
    "description": "LibPNG is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to improper error handling.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `png_free_data` does not properly handle the freeing of text-related data, which can lead to a segmentation fault when called via `png_destroy_read_struct`. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malformed PNG file to be supplied to a victim. If processed, this could cause an application crash.\n\nNote: The author of the advisory originally discovered this issue in PNGwriter, and claimed the issue was caused by the upstream component LibPNG. The vendor states that they have been unable to reproduce the issue in LibPNG, and disputes that this issue is caused by LibPNG.\n\nThere are insufficient technical details available to allow further accurate reporting.",
