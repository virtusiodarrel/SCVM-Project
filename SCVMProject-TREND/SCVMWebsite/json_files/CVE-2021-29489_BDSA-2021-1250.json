    "title": "Highcharts JS  Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'Chart Options' Component",
    "description": "Highcharts JS is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient validation of input from untrusted sources. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser by tricking them into loading a maliciously crafted chart configuration. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "Highchart JS can load a 'chart options' structure from a chart configuration, which can be used to dynamically create web page content. The data contained within this structure is not validated or sanitized. An attacker could insert XSS payloads into this structure, which could then be executed in a victim's browser when the chart information is rendered. This vulnerability is particularly easy to exploit in cases where the `useHTML` flag is set, as HTML strings can be directly injected into the DOM. Successful exploitation may result in sensitive information being extracted from the victim's browser, such as session cookies.",
