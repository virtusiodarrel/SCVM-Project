    "title": "Centreon Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Command Injection in 'displayServiceStatus.php' Script",
    "description": "Centreon is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to a command injection flaw. A remote authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable server by interacting with the  \"Performance Data Management\" user interface.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `www/include/views/graphs/graphStatus/displayServiceStatus.php` executes the statement `popen($command_line, 'r')`. The value of `$command_line` is obtained dynamically using the values of several variables. One of these variables is `$RRDdatabase_path`. \n\nThe value of this variable is obtained by evaluating `getStatusDBDir($pearDBO)`. This function retrieves the first value that is stored in the `RRDdatabase_status_path` column of the `$pearDBO` database. This field is updated via the `updateODSConfigData()` function. The value that is passed to this function can be controlled via the \"Performance Data Management\" user interface. An authenticated attacker can therefore use this interface to store a command injection payload within the database, which will be executed once the relevant statement in `displayServiceStatus.php` is executed.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed via the deletion of the `www/include/views/graphs/graphStatus/displayServiceStatus.php` script.",
