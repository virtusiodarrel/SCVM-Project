    "title": "Pluck Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via Session Fixation in Administrative Login System",
    "description": "Pluck contain a session fixation flaw in its administrative login system that can result in ad admin login session being retained even after an admin has changed their password. An attacker could exploit this flaw to bypass the authentication mechanism and access the application.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists because the application does not properly invalidate prior sessions after a password change operation. To exploit this flaw, an attacker will first need to have gained access to the application through another exploit. After that, the attacker can use `PHPSESSID` cookie to get sustained access to the application even after an admin has changed the password. As specified in the PoC, the attacker can use any arbitrary value for `PHPSESSID` and bypass the authentication mechanism. Also, because the application does not properly invalidate sessions, the attacker can also brute-force the session IDs in order to log in.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in `admin.php` and `data/inc/changepass.php` files by implementing appropriate session expiration mechanisms and regularly regenerating session IDs.",
