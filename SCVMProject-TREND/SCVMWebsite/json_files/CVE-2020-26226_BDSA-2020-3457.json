    "description": "semantic-release is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the improper handling of certain secret characters whenever URL encoding is being performed.",
    "technicalDescription": "semantic-release can mask strings that contain sensitive information by shielding them (via the `replace()` method) with a constant that is retrieved from `lib/definitions/constants.js`. A regular expression, which is stored within the `regexp` variable, is used to locate sensitive strings. This is constructed (via the `toReplace()` method) from a list of hard-coded strings that includes `token`, `password` and `credential`. However, the construction of the regular expression does not take into account URI encoding. Hence, sensitive strings that have been URI encoded will not be matched. An attacker could potentially exploit this in order to recover sensitive information from URL-encoded output.",
