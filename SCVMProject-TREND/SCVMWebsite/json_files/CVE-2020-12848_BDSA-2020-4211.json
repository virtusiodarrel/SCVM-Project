    "title": "Pydio Cells Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Exposed Credentials in Shared Files",
    "description": "Pydio Cells contains a vulnerability in its file sharing system that results in exposed user credentials. An unauthenticated attacker could use a publicly shared file to obtain these credentials and log in to the application.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability results when an authenticated user creates a public link for sharing a file with other users. However, a hidden shared user account is also created in the backend that is associated with this link. An attacker who has access to the link can obtain the username for this hidden account via the `PRELOG_USER` value in the page response. Then, the attacker can log in to the application using this username and a password that is constructed by appending `#$!Az1` to the username. This will result in the attacker accessing the application with low privileges and performing actions like changing the profile picture of the account and adding comments.",
