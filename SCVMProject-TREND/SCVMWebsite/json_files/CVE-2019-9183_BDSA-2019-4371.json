    "description": "Contiki and Contiki-NG are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause the application to crash by generating maliciously crafted network traffic.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `sicslowpan.c` contains a variety of functions that are used for reassembling fragmented 6LoWPAN packets. These include `store_fragment()`, `add_fragment()` and `copy_frags2uip()`. These functions track the size of the fragment being manipulated using the `len` variable, which is calculated by subtracting `packetbuf_hdr_len` from `packetbuf_datalen`. No validation is performed on the value of `len` to ensure that it is an acceptable value. If malformed fragments are being processed, it may be possible for an integer underflow to occur, causing `len` to have a negative value. The application will then proceed to copy `len` bytes of data into the buffer denoted by `frag_buf[i].data`. The negative value of `len` will be treated as being positive, which will cause a very large amount of data to be copied. This could lead to an exception being raised, which will halt program execution. A remote attacker could therefore cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending maliciously crafted 6LoWPAN packets to the application.",
