    "title": "RPM Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Symbolic Link Race Conditions in Installation Process",
    "description": "RPM is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue due to a symbolic link flaw that exists in the installation process.\n\nThis issue could be abused in order to escalate the privileges of a local \"unprivileged\" user to root.\n\n**Note**: A Red Hat engineer has stated [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1964114#c10) that in this context, \"unprivileged\" users are system accounts, like `pcpqa` for example, that are usually more tightly controlled than ordinary users. Accessing files and directories installed by RPMs requires high privileges.",
    "technicalDescription": "RPM is vulnerable to privilege escalation because permissions and credentials are set after new files are installed using path-based operations that can potentially follow symbolic links. \n\nA race condition exists that could allow target files (that an \"unprivileged\" user has control over) to be exchanged with a symbolic link to a security-critical file that, when the RPM installation is carried out, could then allow for the privileges of the user to be escalated.",
