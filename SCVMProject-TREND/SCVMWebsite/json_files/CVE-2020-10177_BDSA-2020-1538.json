    "title": "Pillow Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Out-of-Bounds Read in 'FliDecode.c'",
    "description": "Pillow is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could cause the application to crash by causing it to process a maliciously crafted input file, either by tricking a user into downloading and loading a malicious file or by sending a malicious file to a program which uses this library to process files retrieved over the network.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in `ImagingFliDecode` function found in `src/libImaging/FliDecode.c` due to missing checks where buffers are accessed with user controlled input which could result in out-of-bounds reads. There are are multiple instances in this function where there are missing checks to ensure only the maximum amount of memory from a buffer is accessed.\n\nThis issue was resolved with a check to ensure for any specified offset of data, the result of `data + (offset)` is not greater than `ptr + bytes` which would result in out-of-bounds access.",
