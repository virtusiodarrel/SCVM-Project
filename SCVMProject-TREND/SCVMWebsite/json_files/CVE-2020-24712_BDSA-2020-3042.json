    "title": "Gophish Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'IMAP' Hostname",
    "description": "Gophish is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the improper validation of user-supplied input in its search functionality. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts in a victim's browser, which could allow them to steal sensitive information such as authentication tokens and user session cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists within the files `static/js/src/app/settings.js` and `atic/js/dist/app/settings.min.js`. This is due to a lack of sanitization of the `IMAP` host field on the account settings page, which is derived from client-provided input. Attackers can use this to inject malicious scripts into content served by the application. These can be executed by a victim's browser, allowing the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.\n\nThe issue was fixed by using the `escapeHtml()` function to sanitize client-provided input.",
