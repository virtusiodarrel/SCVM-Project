    "description": "axTLS is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause an instance of the application to crash by conducting a malicious TLS certificate handshake.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `process_certificate()`, which is defined within `tls1.c`, is used to parse X.509 certificates. This function performs two heap memory allocations using the `calloc()` function, and stores the resulting pointers in the variables `certs` and `certs_used`. The quantity of memory to be allocated depends on the value of the `num_certs` variable. The value of `num_certs` corresponds to the number of certificates that have been specified in a TLS certificate handshake message. The value of `num_certs` is not validated prior to the aforementioned allocation. If it is zero, no memory will be allocated. The process later attempts to write to the memory buffer pointed to by `certs_used`. As no buffer actually exists, this constitutes an out-of-bounds write operation. This could lead to an exception being raised, halting program execution and causing a denial-of-service (DoS). A remote attacker could therefore cause an instance of the application to crash by conducting a malicious TLS certificate handshake.",
