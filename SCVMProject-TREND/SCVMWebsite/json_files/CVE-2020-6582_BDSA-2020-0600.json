    "description": "Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could exploit this to cause an application crash leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `read_packet()` function in `src/nrpe.c` does not check the size of `buffer_size` before adding it to the `pkt_size`.\n\nThe `buffer_size` value, taken from the user input `buffer_length`, is of type int32_t, a signed integer for the v3 packet format. This would allow an attacker to provide a negative buffer length, such as `-19`.\n\nThe `pkt_size` is defined as `int32_t   pkt_size = sizeof(v3_packet) - 1;` which results in `pkt_size` having the value of `19`. When a malicious `buffer_size` is added to `pkt_size` this results in `pkt_size` being `0` and results in a call to `calloc(1,0)` which is a zero memory allocation. This could lead to unusual behavior itself, however in this case it will return a pointer to allocated memory of the minimal heap chunk size, 16 bytes for 32 bit and 32 byte for 64 bit operating systems.\n\nThe `buff_ptr`, the pointer to the zero memory allocation, and `bytes_to_recv`, which is set to `-19` the value of `buffer_size` are used in the call to receive the rest of the NRPE v3 packet over the network. In this call to `recvall()` the negative integer will be converted to an unsigned integer, resulting in a large number being used to read and copy network traffic into the small buffer.\n\nThe current thread will crash due to the call which occurs as part of the `recvall()` function to `bzero` which uses the small buffer and large unsigned integer created due to the `-19` value.",
