    "title": "tcpdump Vulnerable to Buffer Over-read in hncp_print_rec",
    "description": "tcpdump is an open source packet analyzer that can be run in the command line. It contains a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability where the application reads past the buffer's boundary, reading the adjacent memory. This can result in the exposure of sensitive information or a Denial of Service (*DoS*) attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is currently under continuous review and will be updated with the most current information.",
    "technicalDescription": "tcpdump contains a heap-based buffer over-read flaw within the function `hncp_print_rec` in the file `print-hncp.c`. There is an issue of how tcpdump checks the bounds of memory buffers resulting in the buffer reading the adjacent memory.\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to potentially gain sensitive information and cause a Denial of Service (*DoS*) attack.\n\nThere are insufficient technical details available to allow further accurate reporting.\n\nThis vulnerability is currently embargoed by the maintainer. This means that much of the information necessary to make an accurate assessment of the technical details and the CVSS scoring is private and therefore unavailable. Analysis is based on the best information available at the time of writing and is therefore fully subject to change as further details emerge.",
