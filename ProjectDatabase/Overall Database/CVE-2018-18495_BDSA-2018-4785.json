    "title": "Mozilla Firefox Vulnerable to Authorization Bypass via 'about:' Page",
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to the bypassing of its sandboxing policies due to the mishandling of content scripts. This could potentially be leveraged to access functionality normally restricted from extensions and interfere with the loading and usage of these pages.\n\nIt should be noted that Firefox ESR is only affected if it is running on Windows.",
    "technicalDescription": "Firefox will load content scripts into the `about:blank` context before the destination `about: ` page is loaded. This can lead to the script being loaded into the main process, provided the destination is in the main process. This undermines Firefox's process sandboxing policy. An attacker could potentially use this to access functionality that is normally withheld from extensions, and interfere with the loading and usage of web pages. It should be noted that the victim must have already installed a malicious extension for an attacker to be able to cause an adverse effect.\n\nIt should also be noted that Firefox ESR is only affected if it is running on Windows.",
