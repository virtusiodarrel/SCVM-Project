    "title": "Prism Vulnerable to DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Command Line Plugin",
    "description": "Prism contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of escaped output. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing maliciously crafted JavaScript through HTML tags. This could potentially lead to a loss of sensitive information, such as cookies and session tokens.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue exists within the `prism-command-line.js` file, where improperly escaped output from the Command Line plugin leads to input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML code. This was mitigated by including escaping in `outputLines()` through `Prism.util.encode`.",
