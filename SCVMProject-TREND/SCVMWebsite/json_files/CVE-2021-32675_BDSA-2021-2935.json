    "title": "Redis Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Excessive Memory Allocation Caused by Large Bulk Headers",
    "description": "Redis is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to an excessive memory allocation which can be triggered by receiving Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) requests. Redis allocates memory according to the user-specified values in RESP requests, meaning an attacker could deliver crafted requests over multiple connections in order to allocate a significant amount of memory. This vulnerability may also be exploited by unauthenticated users via authentication requests.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing large bulk and multi-bulk headers in requests. The issue was fixed by setting a low limit for multibulk and bulk length for unauthenticated connections. The new limits are 10 arguments of 16kb each.",
