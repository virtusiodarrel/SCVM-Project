    "title": "tcpdump Vulnerable to Infinite Loop in print-resp.c",
    "description": "tcpdump is an open source packet analyzer that can be run in the command line. It contains a infinite loop vulnerability where a piece of the application's coding does not have a functional exit meaning the piece of code repeats indefinitely. This can result in an unexpected consumption of resources and in some situations it could be vulnerable to Denial of Service (*DoS*) attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is currently under continuous review and will be updated with the most current information.",
    "technicalDescription": "tcpdump contains an infinite loop flaw within the in the file `print-resp.c`. There is an issue within a section of code where there is no exit condition, meaning the code loops indefinitely which can consume a lot of resources and CPU memory. This flaw allows an attacker to potentially cause a Denial of Service (*DoS*) attack.\n\nThere are insufficient technical details available to allow further accurate reporting.\n\nThis vulnerability is currently embargoed by the maintainer. This means that much of the information necessary to make an accurate assessment of the technical details and the CVSS scoring is private and therefore unavailable. Analysis is based on the best information available at the time of writing and is therefore fully subject to change as further details emerge.",
