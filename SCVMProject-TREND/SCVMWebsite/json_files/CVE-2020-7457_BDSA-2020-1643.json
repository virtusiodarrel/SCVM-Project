    "title": "FreeBSD Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Use-After-Free in Socket Option Handler",
    "description": "FreeBSD is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A local attacker could execute arbitrary code in kernel mode by running a maliciously crafted binary on a vulnerable system.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `ip6_output.c` contains code that is used by FreeBSD to manage IPv6 sockets. This includes a switch statement that handles different socket options. Whenever the `IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS` case is being executed, the `ip6_pcbopts()` function is called with an argument of `&in6p->in6p_outputopts`, which is a `ip6_pktopts` type structure. This structure contains the pointer `ip6po_pktinfo`, which points to dynamically allocated memory. As no lock is imposed prior to the call to `ip6_pcbopts()`, a race condition can occur which will lead to `ip6po_pktinfo` being used after it has been freed. This use-after-free can be exploited in order to read and write arbitrary values in kernel memory. This can be used by a local attacker to obtain arbitrary code execution with root privileges on a vulnerable machine.",
