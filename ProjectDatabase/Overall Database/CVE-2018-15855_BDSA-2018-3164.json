    "description": "libxkbcommon is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to improper handling of the desupported geometry section. An attacker could leverage this flaw by supplying a crafted keymap file.",
    "technicalDescription": "libxkbcommon removed support for the `xkb_geometry` section - used for information on the physical layout of a keyboard - but allowed it to still be accepted by the parser for backwards compatibility. However, as a result of this the section's `XkbFile` was replaced by a `NULL` return, which is not properly handled by the parser, and can lead to a `NULL` pointer dereference. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malformed keymap file to be supplied to a victim. If processed, this could cause an application crash.",
