    "description": "It has been reported that Exponent content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via the Extension Upload functionality. An authenticated Super-Admin could upload a crafted extension that would add a malicious page on the website. Once installed and visited, the page would allow remotely executing arbitrary OS commands on the host.\n\n**Note:** The vendor has responded that users with Super-Admin privileges can already cause a high impact on the website by design and that this is not an issue that needs to be fixed.",
    "technicalDescription": "A malicious PHP file could be uploaded via `'Super-Admin Tools' > 'Extensions' > 'Install Extension'`. The payload `<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>` would allow remotely executing commands on the host.",
