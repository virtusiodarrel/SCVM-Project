    "title": "NetHack Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in MENUCOLOR Configuration FIle",
    "description": "NetHack contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, thus crashing the application. It has been reported that privilege escalation and remote code execution (RCE) could potentially be achieved.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists within the `doc/fixes36.5` and `src/options.c` files, when reading very long lines from a NetHack MENUCOLOR configuration file. When NetHack is installed as `suid/sgid`attackers with ability to upload their own configuration file could exploit this, resulting in a buffer overflow and causing a DoS condition to occur. It has been reported that privilege escalation and remote code execution are possible outcomes, but these have not been demonstrated.",
