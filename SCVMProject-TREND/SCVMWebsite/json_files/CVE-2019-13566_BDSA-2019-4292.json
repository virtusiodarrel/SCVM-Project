    "description": "ROS communications-related packages is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by sending maliciously crafted network traffic.",
    "technicalDescription": "The functions `TransportTCP::connect()` and `TransportUDP::getClientURI()`, which are defined within the files `transport_tcp.cpp` and `transport_udp.cpp` respectively, make use of a stack buffer variable called `namebuf`. This buffer is used to store address data that is obtained from packets received from a client. This data is copied into the buffer via the `strcpy()` function. No validation is performed to ensure that the data to be copied can fit inside this buffer. An remote attacker could therefore cause a buffer overflow by sending maliciously crafted packets that contain large address fields. This could trigger an exception, halting program execution and causing a DoS.",
