    "title": "Unbound Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service via Infinite Loop and Reachable Assertion During Malformed Request Parsing",
    "description": "Unbound is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper handling of malformed requests. A remote attacker could cause a server to become unresponsive by sending malformed DNS responses to that server.",
    "technicalDescription": "Unbound parses DNS answers using a variety of functions, including `smart_compare()`. These functions parse the data contained in these responses by accessing the fields that are located at specific memory offsets. The logic by which these fields are processed makes use of various loops and conditional statements. If certain fields are malformed, the exit condition for a loop may not be reachable. This will cause an infinite loop to occur, halting program execution and causing a DoS. A remote attacker could therefore cause a DoS by sending maliciously malformed DNS answers to a vulnerable server.\n\nUnbound also makes use of a variety of assertions, using the `log_assert()` function. A remote attacker may be able to trigger one of these assertions if Unbound has been compiled with the `--enable-debug` flag. This will cause the application to crash",
