    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the unsafe deserialization of classes. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server by causing that server to deserialize a maliciously crafted serialized object.",
    "technicalDescription": "The RCE vulnerability is due to an incomplete default blacklist being used by XStream. A crafted payload making use of the `javax.naming.Binding` class can lead to the execution of code on the server which is deserializing data with XStream.\n\nThe issue was resolved by defaulting to a secure whitelist of allowed classes.",
