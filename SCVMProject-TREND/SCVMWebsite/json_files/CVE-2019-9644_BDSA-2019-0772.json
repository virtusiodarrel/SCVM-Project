    "title": "Jupyter Notebook Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Cross-Site Inclusion (XSSI) Attack",
    "description": "A cross-site inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability has been discovered in Jupyter Notebook. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious page that contains cross-origin resource requests from an unauthorized URL to steal sensitive information. \n\nThis vulnerability has been demonstrated with Internet Explorer as the default error page returns contents of invalid JavaScript.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in Jupyter Notebook which can lead to information exposure. The application does not restrict resources from cross-origin sources properly. The `set_default_headers` function located in the file `notebook/base/handlers.py` does not utilize the `nosniff` option on the `X-Content-Type-Options` to prevent MIME-sniffing. \n\nThere is no white-list prevention to determine verified origins which can be accessed by an HTML page. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious page which can be distributed to a victim. The page contains embedded scripts which reference to known URLs which are to be accessed via cross-origin policies. An authenticated user who accesses this malicious page will provide access for the embedded scripts to recover additional data, which could lead to sensitive information being leaked.",
