    "description": "Xen contains a memory management issue due to a missing TLB flush introduced in error with the fix for **CVE-2022-26362**. The impacts of this can result in a malicious guest that is run in shadow mode causing a host-wide denial-of-service (DoS), but other impacts cannot be ruled out.",
    "technicalDescription": "The fix for **CVE-2022-26362** (Xen security advisory XSA-401) introduced an error in logic that resulted in a missing TLB flush in function `_get_page_type()` of file`xen/arch/x86/mm.c`. This was demonstrated to exhaust host memory via a shadow mode guest. Other impacts have not been ruled out.",
