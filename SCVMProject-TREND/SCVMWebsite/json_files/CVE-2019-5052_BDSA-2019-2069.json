    "description": "SDL2_image is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a crafted PCX file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `IMG_LoadPCX_RW()`, which is defined within the source file `IMG_pcx.c`, contains code that is used by SDL2_image in order to load a PCX type image from an SDL datasource. This function utilizes the signed integer variable `bpl`, the value of which corresponds to the number of bytes per line. This variable is passed as an argument to the function `SDL_RWread()`, which assigns its value to the signed integer type variable `size`. \n\nThe value of `bpl` is determined via the calculation `pcxh.NPlanes * pcxh.BytesPerLine`. It is possible to craft a PCX file which properties such that this calculation will result in a negative value. As a consequence of this, whenever the value of `bpl` is treated as a signed integer (specifically, `size_t`) variable, that value will be extremely large. The value of the variable `surface->pitch` is intended to indiciate the maximum size of the memory buffer that can be written to by this function. Although the function does check to ensure that the size of `bpl` does not exceed `surface->pitch`, the check will be passed if `bpl` is negative.\n\nAs the value of `size` controls the number of bytes that is written to memory by the `SDL_RWread()` function, an attacker can control the number of bytes that is written to memory. They can therefore write to invalid memory addresses  by providing a crafted PCX file that will trigger the aforementioned conditions.",
