    "description": "Knowage is vulnerable to access bypass and username/password hash disclosure via the administration functions. This could allow an attacker to gain administrative access and obtain users' information which could lead to exposed passwords and other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "An attacker could access user information with a REST response by entering an admin username  in the URL. The attacker would need to guess the generic admin user name for this to work. Once a valid admin username is entered, an attacker has access to all usernames and their password hashes. The hashes could then be taken offline and converted to cleartext passwords. Additionally, with these admin credentials, an attacker could create a new user with admin privileges or execute other admin actions.",
