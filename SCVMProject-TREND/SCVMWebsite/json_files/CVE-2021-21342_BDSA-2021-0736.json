    "description": "XStream, when in its default configuration or operating without a sufficient blacklist / whitelist configuration, is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) issue. This is due to how XStream can potentially create new instances of dangerous objects that are not blocked based on the contents of the input stream. The potentially dangerous types in this case are `sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator` and `javax.activation.URLDataSource`.\n\nAn attacker could supply a crafted input to XStream in order request information from internal resources.",
    "technicalDescription": "XStream is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) when running without a sufficient blacklist / whitelist configuration because dangerous type information can be processed. At unmarshalling time, the processed stream contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. New instances are created based on the provided type information, meaning that potentially dangerous types that are not blocked can have new instances created.\n\nAn attacker could get XStream to unmarshal some XML (or another supported format like JSON) that contains  `sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator` and `javax.activation.URLDataSource` types. These types could be used together in order to access an internal resource with an arbitrary URL that resolves to an intranet location or on the local host. \n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated that XStream users who have set up the XStream security framework with a sufficient whitelist limited to the minimal required types are unaffected by this issue.",
