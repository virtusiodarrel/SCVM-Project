    "description": "Openstack Neutron is vulnerable to source address spoofing. An attacker could take advantage of this to impersonate an IPv6 address of another system on the network which will result in a denial-of-service (DoS) for the victim system, as well as the possibility of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by interception of traffic intended for other destinations.\n\n**Note:** A pre-condition for this vulnerability to be exploited is two running VMs in the same L2 flat network with IPv6 connectivity.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists due to the ability of virtual machines using Openstack Neutron to send ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement packets with no check on their content. \n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this to impersonate an IPv6 address of another system on the network which will result in a denial-of-service (DoS) for the victim system, as well as the possibility of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by interception of traffic intended for other destinations.",
