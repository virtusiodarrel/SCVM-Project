    "description": "jsoup is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to flaws in its parsing component. A remote attacker could impact the performance of the application, or cause it to crash, by sending maliciously crafted HTML or XML documents to a vulnerable endpoint.",
    "technicalDescription": "A number of issues exist within jsoup that relate to its HTML and XML parsing functionality. For example, if attribute names or tags are malformed or mismatched, then the performance of the application may be adversely impacted whenever it attempts to process them. It is also possible for unhandled exceptions to be thrown during the traversal and parsing of the document node tree. If an application uses jsoup to process input from untrusted clients, then an attacker could use a maliciously crafted HTML or XML document to cause a DoS.",
