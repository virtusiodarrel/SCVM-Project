    "title": "Teclib GLPI Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via  PHP Type Juggling in 'Auth::checkPassword()' Function",
    "description": "Teclib GLPI is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to an insufficiently strict data type check. An attacker could obtain authorized access to the application by supplying a crafted password.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `checkPassword()`, defined within the script `auth.class.php`, is used to validate a password that has been supplied by a client. A MD5 hash of the password (stored in the variable `$pass`) is generated using the `md5` function, which is then compared to the hash which has been stored by the application (stored in the variable `$hash`). The `==` operator is used to perform this comparison. This operator performs a 'loose' comparison, which uses a set of operand conversion rules. The variables `$pass` and `$hash` are both intended to be of type string, but under certain conditions the PHP interpreter can end up determining that the value of `$pass` is actually numerical (e.g. the number zero). It will then attempt to convert the value of `$hash` so that it is also numerical. This output of this operation can also end up being zero, meaning that the comparison will evaluate as `True` even though the password hash and the stored hash are actually different. An attacker could therefore successfully complete the authentication process by supplying a crafted password value that will trigger this chain of events.",
