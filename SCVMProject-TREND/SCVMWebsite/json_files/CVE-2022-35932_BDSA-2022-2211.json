    "title": "Nextcloud Talk Vulnerable to Brute Force Attacks due to Missing Rate Limit",
    "description": "Nextcloud Talk is vulnerable to brute force attacks against password protected calls. This allows an attacker that has a link to a call but does not know the password, to preform brute force attacks against the password. This is possible due to no rate limiting being performed against authentication attempts.",
    "technicalDescription": "A brute force attack is possible due to no rate limiting or throttling being performed in `lib/Controller/RoomController.php`. This allows an attacker to attempt to enter a password to join a call as many times as they like. This has been fixed by introducing a 30 second throttling delay when too many incorrect password attempts are made.",
