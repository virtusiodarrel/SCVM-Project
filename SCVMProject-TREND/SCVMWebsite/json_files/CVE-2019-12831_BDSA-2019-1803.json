    "description": "An improper input validation vulnerability has been discovered in MyBB. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted file with a maliciously long filename to break the database columns and create a PHP shell on the target system.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in MyBB which can lead to arbitrary code execution against the target system. The `import_theme_xml` function located in the file `admin/inc/functions_theme.php` is implemented to import custom forums themes into the application. The `$stylesheet` parameter utilized by the function is restricted to a 30 character limit which can cause the file type validation check to be manipulated.  A crafted filename called `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.php` will be limited to 30 characters and the file type validation will be bypassed causing the filename to be saved as `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.php` by the application.  \n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted file to manipulate the functionality into breaking the column limit of the database and executing a PHP shell in the cache directory of the target system.",
