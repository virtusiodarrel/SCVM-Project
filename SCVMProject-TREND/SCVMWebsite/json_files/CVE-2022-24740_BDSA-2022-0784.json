    "title": "Volto Vulnerable to Account Hijacking via 'Authentication Token Swap' Issue",
    "description": "Volto is vulnerable to an account hijacking style issue due to how users can potentially have their authentication tokens replaced with those that belong to another user when the server is under high load. This means that unauthorized users could randomly be given full access to the account and privileges of another user.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs due to how an outdated version of the `react-cookie` library is used, which mishandles SSR. \n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated [here](https://github.com/plone/volto/security/advisories/GHSA-cfhh-xgwq-5r67) that a proven exploit for this vulnerability does not exist, since the exact requisites for it to happen have not been fully clarified, and the attempts to reproduce it under testing conditions have been unsuccessful. However, they believe that it still can happen randomly and unintentionally in the wild.",
