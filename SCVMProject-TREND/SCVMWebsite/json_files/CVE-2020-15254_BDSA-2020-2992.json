    "title": "Crossbeam Vulnerable to Undefined Behaviour via Deallocation of 'Vec' Channel Buffer",
    "description": "Crossbeam (crossbeam-channel) is vulnerable to undefined behaviour due to inconsistencies in memory operations that deal with message passing structures. This vulnerability has been observed to cause memory leaks and may cause a denial-of-service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion.",
    "technicalDescription": "It was found that when a bounded channel (`ArrayQueue`) is initialized using `Vec<T>`, its capacity is not guaranteed and the actual layout of the allocated memory could have a greater size. When the channel is dropped this inconsistency causes deallocations of incorrect capacity and eventually results in memory leaks. \n\nThe issue was fixed by using `Box<[T]>` instead of `Vec<T>` in files `crossbeam-queue/src/array_queue.rs` and `crossbeam-channel/src/flavors/array.rs`. Note that although the vendor states the fixed version is **0.4.4**, the officially referenced fix commit is only included in versions starting from **0.5.0**.",
