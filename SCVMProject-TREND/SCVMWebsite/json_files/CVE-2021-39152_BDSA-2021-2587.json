    "title": "XStream Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unsafe Nashorn Class Deserialization",
    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) due to the improper restriction of deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could send requests to intranet hosts by sending maliciously crafted serialized data to a vulnerable server.\n\n **Note** If the application uses XStreams security framework and whitelist approach to deserialization (recommended), it is not vulnerable.",
    "technicalDescription": "Java classes from the `jdk.nashorn.internal.runtime` package provide an API for the Java Nashorn engine. This package includes the `Source` class. Instances of this class can specify URLs and references to character set resources via the `url` and `cs` attributes, respectively. The application can then submit requests to retrieve data from these resources.\n\nIf a server uses XStream in order to deserialize untrusted input, then an attacker can send that server serialized instances of `jdk.nashorn.internal.runtime.Source` objects which reference intranet resources or resources on the local machine. The application will attempt to retrieve these resources upon deserialization. This allows the attacker to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, which could allow them to retrieve sensitive information from intranet machines or the server itself. This vulnerability affects servers which use versions **8** to **14** of the Java runtime.  The problematic classes must be present in the vulnerable application's class path in order for such an attack to be carried out.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by the implementation of a whitelisting approach by default. Classes which are not included in the whitelist will not be deserialized by XStream.",
