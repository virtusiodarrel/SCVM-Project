    "title": "Cacti Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unsafe Deserialization in 'sanitize_unserialize_selected_items()' Function",
    "description": "Cacti is vulnerable to remote code execution due to the unsafe handling of client-controlled data. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the underlying system by submitting crafted requests. The attacker could also influence in-memory data, and could also cause the application to crash.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `sanitize_unserialize_selected_items()`, which is defined within the file `functions.php`, is called whenever Cacti is performing the deserialization of form data. The relevant form data is stored within the variable `$items`. This variable is passed as an argument to the `stripslashes()` function in order to perform some rudimentary sanitization. The output of this function is then passed as an argument to the `unserialize()` function. No validation or sanitization is performed to prevent a dangerous deserialization operation from taking place. The deserialized data could contain functions that will be automatically executed upon evaluation of the `unserialize()` function. Other possible outcomes of this unsafe deserialization operation is the unauthorized manipulation of in-memory objects, which could lead to unexpected program behavior or a crash. Memory corruption is also a possible outcome of this unsafe deserialization operation. A remote attacker could therefore execute code on the underlying system, or cause the application to crash, by submitting crafted form data.",
