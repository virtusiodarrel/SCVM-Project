    "title": "Pandora FMS Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbirary File Upload in 'File Repository' Component",
    "description": "Pandora FMS is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to unsafe file upload functionality. A remote attacker with administrative privileges could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server by uploading a malicious PHP file via the File Repository manager.",
    "technicalDescription": "The administrative interface of Pandora FMS allows users to upload files with a `.php` extension, via the File Repository component. The user cannot, however, open and execute the file through this component. This functionality is implemented via several files and functions, including `functions_filemanager.php` and `get_file.php`. The code contained within `get_file.php` manually crafts a HTTP response to ensure that a `.php` file is not executed, but instead has its contents returned to the user. However, it is possible for the user to browse to the `pandora_console/attachment/file_repo/` directory and access the file directly. Whenever the file is opened from this directory, it will be executed. A remote attacker with administrative credentials could therefore execute arbitrary code on the underlying server by uploading a maliciously crafted PHP file and then accessing it inside the `file_repo` directory.",
