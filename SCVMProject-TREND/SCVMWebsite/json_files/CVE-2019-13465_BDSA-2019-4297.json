    "title": "ROS communications-related packages Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Out-of-Bounds Access in 'remove()' Function",
    "description": "ROS communications-related packages is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could potentially cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by generating maliciously crafted network traffic.\n\nIt should be noted that the vendor has stated that this does not constitute an exploitable vulnerability.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `remove()`, which is defined within `spinner.cpp`, uses an iterator loop in order to access the elements of an array. The iterator loop can be halted via the `ROS_ASSERT_MSG` assertion. This assertion can only be triggered whenever `ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED` is defined. If `ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED` has not been defined, the iterator loop can run indefinitely, which will lead to an attempt to access memory that lies outside of the array's boundaries. This can generate an exception, halting program execution. An attacker could therefore potentially cause a DoS by supplying maliciously crafted input to an instance of the application in which `ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED` has not been defined.\n\nIt should be noted that the vendor has stated that the initial vulnerability report was a false alarm, and that an exploitable vulnerability is not actually present.",
