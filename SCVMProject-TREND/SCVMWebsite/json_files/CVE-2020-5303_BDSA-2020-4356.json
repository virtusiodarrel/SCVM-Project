    "title": "Tendermint Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via P2P Out-of-Memory and 'activeID' Node Panic Issues",
    "description": "Tendermint is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions due to the presence of two separate issues: out-of-memory exceptions that can occur as Tendermint does not limit the number of P2P connection requests, and a panic that can occur if the `activeIDs` map reaches its maximum size.\n\nAn attacker could trigger either of the issues by submitting a large number of requests in order impact stability and availability.",
    "technicalDescription": "Tendermint is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions for two reasons:\n\n* Reason 1: Tendermint does not limit the number of P2P connection requests where for each connection a set amount of memory is allocated. This can cause temporary memory spikes which can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions.\n\n* Reason 2: When a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and added to all reactors, Tendermint does not reclaim the `activeID` of the peer after it is removed in `Mempool` reactor. This can lead to the `activeIDs` map growing in size. If the map reaches its maximum size of 65535, a node panic can occur.\n\n**Note**: These issues are independent of each other and can be abused separately.",
