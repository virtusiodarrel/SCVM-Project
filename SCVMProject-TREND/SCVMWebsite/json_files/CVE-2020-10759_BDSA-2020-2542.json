    "description": "fwupd is vulnerable to installation of unsigned firmware via PGP signature bypass. This could allow an attacker with administrative credentials to cause the application to treat unsigned data as if it were signed.",
    "technicalDescription": "The PGP-based metadata signature verification was found to be vulnerable, because of this any non-detached signature signed by any key could bypass the verification logic. An attacker who is able to place themselves between fwupd clients and a metadata repository could provide signed malicious firmware update information to fwupd clients. This issue has been mitigated by validating that the `gpgme_op_verify_result` function returns at least one signature.",
