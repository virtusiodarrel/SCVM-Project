    "title": "Multiple Mozilla Products Vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass via 'allow-popups' Flag Handling",
    "description": "Firefox, Firefox ESR and Thunderbird are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper implementation of pop-up functionality. A remote attacker could bypass the sandbox restrictions that have been imposed on web content by using maliciously crafted content. This could assist them in conducting further attacks.",
    "technicalDescription": "An issue exists within the handling of the `allow-popups` flag. This issue can cause the restrictions associated within the `sandbox` keyword within an `iframe` element to be ineffective. This is due to the value of the `loadInDifferentProcess` boolean value being incorrectly assigned within the file `ContentChild.cpp`. A remote attacker could bypass these restrictions by using maliciously crafted content that makes use of `noopener` links. This would make it seem as though the attacker's content is associated with the origin of the genuine web content, which could assist the attacker in conducting further attacks.",
