    "title": "Samba Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Password Change Restriction Bypass",
    "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability has been discovered in Samba. Since the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the `kpasswd` service both use the same account and set of keys confusion between TGS (Ticket-Granting Service) and `kpasswd tickets` could occur, and lead to potential confidentiality and integrity issues. Presenting TGT's as `kpasswd` tickets could potentially result in access to a stolen cache and ultimately result in account takeover via a password change.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the implementation of the KDC and the `kpasswd` service. It was mitigated by restricting the lifetime of `kpasswd` tickets to two minutes, and by ensuring that the KDC no longer accepts Ticket-Granting Service (TGT)'s with a lifetime of two minutes or less so that it does not inadvertently accept `kpasswd` tickets.",
