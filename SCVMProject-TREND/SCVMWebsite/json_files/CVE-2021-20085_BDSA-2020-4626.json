    "description": "backbone-query-parameters is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to the unsafe modification of object attributes. An attacker could potentially achieve a variety of impacts, such as denial-of-service (DoS) or cross-site scripting (XSS), by tricking a victim into interacting with maliciously crafted web content.",
    "technicalDescription": "The ` _setParamValue()` method, of file `backbone-query-parameters/backbone.queryparams.js`, is invoked by functions such as `_extractParameters()` in order to modify the properties of objects. The values which are used in this process can be derived from the requests of clients. No restrictions are imposed on the properties that can be modified. An attacker who is able to trick a victim into submitting a maliciously crafted request could leverage this to perform client-side prototype pollution. The attacker may be able to achieve a variety of impacts, such as DoS or XSS.",
