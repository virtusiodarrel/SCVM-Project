    "title": "UPX Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Integer Overflow During ELF File Unpacking",
    "description": "UPX is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the possibility of utilizing values that are larger than expected. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using a maliciously crafted input file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `p_lx_elf.cpp` contains a variety of functions that are used by UPX to process 64-bit and 32-bit ELF files. These functions access the sections within the input ELF file in order to extract various values, which are stored in variables such as `hashtab` and `d_val`. If the ELF files sections are malformed, the application may attempt to assign values to these variables which are larger than the maximum size permitted by their type. This can lead to an integer overflow, which can in turn cause the application to crash. An attacker could therefore cause DoS by tricking a victim into running the application using a maliciously crafted ELF file as input.",
