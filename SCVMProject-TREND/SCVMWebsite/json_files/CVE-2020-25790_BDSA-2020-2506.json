    "description": "Typesetter Content Management System (CMS) was found to be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via bypass of uploading restrictions. Maliciously crafted PHP files could result in arbitrary code execution.",
    "technicalDescription": "It was discovered that bypass of file restrictions is possible via upload of .PHP files inside a .ZIP file. Once uploaded the file can be extracted and used to execute commands on the machine through use of a malicious webshell. \n\n**Note:** Per the Vendor \"While this is an 'authenticated RCE', which clearly contradicts our security policy, Typesetter is not a community platform and there is no way to register user accounts yourself, which could do such things. So, Typesetter admins are considered trustworthy. Nevertheless it is something that must not happen and our next release will prevent this as far as I know\".",
