    "description": "next-auth contains an insecure email token verification vulnerability in Prisma adapter. This can allow an attacker to use a valid token assigned to one user, to sign in as another user. \n\n**Note:** The vendor has stated that only implementations using the Prisma database adapter with the Email provider are impacted and is not present in the default database adapter (TypeORM).",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability occurs when using the Prisma adapter in conjunction with the Email provider in next-auth. The `verificationRequest` process in `src/adapters/prisma/index.js` does not properly delete verification entries after they are used. This can allow an attacker to use a valid token assigned to one user, to sign in as another user. \n\n**Note:** The vendor has stated that only implementations using the Prisma database adapter with the Email provider are impacted and is not present in the default database adapter (TypeORM).",
