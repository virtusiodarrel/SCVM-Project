This could allow an attacker to inject responses on a client connection and potentially gain unauthorized access to data, as well as achieve cache poisoning.",

To deploy the workaround, put the following VCL configuration towards the top of the VCL configuration:\n\n```\nsub vsv8 {\n    if ((req.http.Content-Length || req.http.Transfer-Encoding) &&\n      req.proto != \"HTTP/2.0\") {\n        set resp.http.Connection = \"close\";\n    }\n}\n\nsub vcl_synth { call vsv8; }\nsub vcl_deliver { call vsv8; }\n```",
