    "description": "October content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to a file modification issue. An attacker could use this to perform an exploit via a victim's spreadsheet software.",
    "technicalDescription": "An attacker could exploit this issue if they have permissions required to modify data that can be exported by the `ImportExportController`. By editing a CSV file, they can cause this file to be malicious when eventually exported. \n\n**Note** the vendor states that there are three conditions required for this to be exploitable. An attacker must:\n\n1. Have found a vulnerability in the victim's spreadsheet software of choice.\n2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim.\n3. Convince the victim to export the above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software.\n\n**Note** This fix has been stated by the vendor to be temporary until the \"L6 upgrade can be merged in to use league/csv >= 9.1\"",
