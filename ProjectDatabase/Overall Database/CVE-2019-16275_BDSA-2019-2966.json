    "title": "hostapd and wpa_supplicant Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Improper Source Address Validation",
    "description": "hostapd and wpa_supplicant do not properly process management frames with an invalid source address leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a crafted unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause any associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all hostapd and wpa_supplicant versions with PMF support and a runtime configuration enabled AP mode with PMF enabled. Additionally this is only applicable when using user space based MLME/SME in AP mode. This condition would be applicable mainly with drivers that use mac80211.",
    "technicalDescription": "hostapd and wpa_supplicant (when controlling AP mode) do not perform sufficient source address validation for some management frames which could result in a frame being sent which causes associate stations to incorrectly believe they were disconnected from the network even if management frame protection (also known as PMF) was negotiated for the association.",
