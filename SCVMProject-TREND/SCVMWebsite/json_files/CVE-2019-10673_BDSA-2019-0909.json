    "description": "WordPress Ultimate Member plugin contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to a missing security measure or token, within the request for an administrator to change their email address in the profile settings update. An attacker is able to trick a user into changing their email address to one that is controlled by the attacker.",
    "technicalDescription": "Due to the lack of a security check on updating the administrator profile settings, an attacker is able to takeover their account.  The profile details can be saved without any values at all including the password.\n\nAfter the email address change, any emails regarding changes and updates to the user's profile do not go to the user, but to the attacker's  changed email address. The attacker can send a reset password request and change the administrator's password, taking control of their account. The victim would not be aware of any changes until they are locked out of their account.\n\nThis can allow an unauthorized attacker to steal sensitive information, activate and disable plugins, add new admin users and modify files on the server potentially allowing code execution.\n\nAn administrator's username is required for a successful attack.",
