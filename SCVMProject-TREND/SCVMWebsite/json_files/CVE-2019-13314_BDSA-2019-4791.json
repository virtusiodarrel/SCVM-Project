    "title": "virt-bootstrap Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Unsafe Process Listing Implementation",
    "description": "virt-bootstrap is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to the usage of unsafe command line options. A local attacker could obtain the root password for a system by accessing the process listing for that system, and then examining the arguments that the application was invoked with.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `virt_bootstrap.py` file contains code that is called during the invocation of virt-bootstrap. This code allows the application to be started with the command line argument `--root-password`. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain the root password, as the flags with which applications are started are displayed within the system's process listing.\n\nThe issue was fixed including code that makes a file the default way by which the root password should be passed in.",
