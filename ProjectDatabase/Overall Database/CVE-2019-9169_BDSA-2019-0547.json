    "description": "The Gnu C library is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using crafted input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `proceed_next_node()`, defined within `regexec.c`, compares the contents of two memory regions using the `memcmp` function. The quantity of memory that is compared is denoted by the value stored within the variable `naccepted`. The memory regions to be compared are intended to lie within the boundaries of the buffer `buf`, and are located at two different offsets from the beginning of this buffer. The value of the first offset is calculated as `regs[subexp_idx].rm_so`, whilst the value of the second offset is obtained by dereferencing the pointer `pidx`. Both `regs` and `pidx` are passed as arguments to `proceed_next_node()`, and their values are dependent on user-provided input. No validation is performed to ensure that the value of `pidx` is sufficiently small such that `naccepted` bytes can follow this offset in `buf` without extending beyond its boundaries. As a consequence of this, a buffer over-read can occur whenever certain input values are being processed by the library.  An attacker could therefore cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program using crafted input that will cause this buffer over-read to take place.",
