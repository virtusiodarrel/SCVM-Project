    "title": "WebKit GTK Vulnerable to Universal Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Race Condition in Page Caching Functionality",
    "description": "WebKit GTK is vulnerable to universal cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a race condition. An attacker could execute JavaScript in the context of a given web page by tricking a victim into navigating from that page to one that contains crafted content. It should be noted that an attacker can only exploit the vulnerability using web pages that contain a specific kind of content.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `FrameLoader` component of WebKit GTK is used to manage the attachment of documents to frames.  Under certain conditions, two documents may be attached to the same frame. For example, this may occur whenever a user navigates from a cached page that is being restored to a page that cannot be cached. As the two documents are attached to the same frame, JavaScript executed by one frame will also be executed in the context of the other attached frame. \n\nAn attacker could therefore execute arbitrary scripts within the context of target web pages by tricking a victim into visiting a crafted page which will trigger the aforementioned a page load event. It should be noted that that target page that is loaded must have an `iframe` component that contains attacker controlled content, which limits the applicability of this vulnerability. This is due to the call stack that must occur for successful exploitation.",
