    "description": "Poppler is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to memory corruption that is caused by a recursive function call. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a crafted PDF file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `JBIG2Stream::readGenericBitmap()`, which is defined within `JBIG2Stream.cc`, contains code that is used by the Poppler `pdfseparate ` utility in order to process input PDF files. This function conducts a decoding routine that is controlled by a variety of loops and switch statements. The intention of these statements is to run the appropriate decoding functions across the PDF file's composite bits in a recursive manner until the decoding routine is complete, and the bitmap image is represented correctly in memory. However, for certain input files, the structure of the bitmap is such that the decoding functionality must be recursively called a very large number of times in order to arrive at the correct in-memory structure. Each recursive call will require an additional stack frame to be constructed; if enough stack frames are created, all available stack memory space will be consumed. Another attempt to write to stack memory will consititute an illegitimate memory access operation, generating a segmentation fault and halting program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the program with a crafted PDF file as input.",
