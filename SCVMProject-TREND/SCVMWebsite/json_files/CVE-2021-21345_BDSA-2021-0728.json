    "description": "XStream, when in its default configuration or operating without a sufficient blacklist / whitelist configuration, is vulnerable to an arbitrary command execution issue. This is due to how XStream can potentially create new instances of dangerous objects that are not blocked based on the contents of the input stream. The potentially dangerous type in this case is `com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry`.\n\nAn attacker could supply a crafted input to XStream in order execute arbitrary commands on the XStream host.",
    "technicalDescription": "XStream is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution when running without a sufficient blacklist / whitelist configuration because dangerous type information can be processed. At unmarshalling time, the processed stream contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. New instances are created based on the provided type information, meaning that potentially dangerous types that are not blocked can have new instances created.\n\nAn attacker with sufficient rights to execute commands of the host could get XStream to unmarshal some XML (or another supported format like JSON) that contains a `com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry` type in order to execute arbitrary commands locally on the XStream host.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated that XStream users who have set up the XStream security framework with a sufficient whitelist limited to the minimal required types are unaffected by this issue.",
