    "title": "Bottle Vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via Unsafe Query String Splitting",
    "description": "Bottle is vulnerable to web cache poisoning due to the implementation of an unsafe string separator character. A remote attacker could cause malicious queries to be cached by sending maliciously crafted requests to a vulnerable server.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `parse_range_header()`, of file `bottle.py`, allows for query strings to be split on the `;` character. This character is no longer considered to be a valid separator. This behavior can cause a query string to be interpreted differently by a server instance and a proxy instance. This can, in turn, cause malicious queries to be cached as though they were safe. An attacker could therefore conduct a web cache poisoning attack by using maliciously crafted query strings that contain the `;` character.",
