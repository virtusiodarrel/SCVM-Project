    "description": "SiteOrigin Page Builder Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient validation of client-provided input. A remote attacker could execute requests on behalf of an administrator, provided they can get the administrator to interact with maliciously crafted web content. The attacker could also execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking that victim into opening maliciously crafted web content. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "SiteOrigin Page Builder Plugin for WordPress is capable of generating nonces in order to verify requests. The function `action_builder_content()`, of file `inc/admin.php`, fails to verify nonces that are associated with the `panels_action` component. This could allow attackers to forge requests on behalf of an administrator, provided they can get the administrator to interact with maliciously crafted web content. It may also be possible for an attacker to carry out XSS attacks, due to insufficient request parameter validation being performed in the file `siteorigin-panels.php`.",
