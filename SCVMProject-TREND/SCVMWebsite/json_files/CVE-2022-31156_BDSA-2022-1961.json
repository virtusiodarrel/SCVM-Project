    "title": "Gradle Vulnerable to Accepting Untrusted Dependencies via Dependency Verification Flaw",
    "description": "Gradle is vulnerable to a dependency verification flaw that could lead to untrusted dependencies being accepted.\n\nThis can manifest as dependency confusion/poisoning, where Gradle could download a malicious binary due to it having a similar name. If HTTPS is not being used for downloading dependencies, this could permit man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks which result in a malicious library being downloaded instead of the expected one.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue can occur under two specific circumstances:\n* When the 'signature verification' functionality is disabled, but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element, but no `checksum` element.\n* When the 'signature verification' functionality is enabled and the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element, but there is no signature file on the remote repository.\n\nThese cases can result in the acceptance of the dependency while correct signature verification is skipped with no notification that the dependency has no checksum entry.",
