    "title": "Log4j 1.x Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via JMSAppender Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
    "description": "Log4j **1.x** versions are vulnerable to deserializing untrusted data if configured to use `JMSAppender` (which is not the default). A remote attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary code on the underlying system with the privileges of the application that is running Log4j.\n\n**Note** that Log4j **1.x** has been marked EOL for many years and has not received updates in this time.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability only manifests when applications are specifically configured to use `JMSAppender`, which is not the default. The application could be vulnerable if the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration so that they could add `JMSAppender` to the attacker's JMS broker.\n\nThe application is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) (when `JMSAppender` is enabled) in a similar fashion to BDSA-2021-3731 (CVE-2021-44228) in the **2.x** series.",
