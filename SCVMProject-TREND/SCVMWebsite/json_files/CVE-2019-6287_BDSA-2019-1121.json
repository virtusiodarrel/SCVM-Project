    "title": "Rancher Vulnerable to Improper Access Control via Role Based Access Control in Projects",
    "description": "Rancher is vulnerable to improper access control. A logic flaw allows members who have been removed from a project to retain the access to create, update, read, and delete `namespaces`.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability is caused by two logic flaws in the role-based access control (RBAC). These flaws prevents `roleBindings` being properly updated after a member has been removed from a project.  \n\n`roleBindings` are used to enforce role-based access control (RBAC). `roleBinding` is a Kubernetes concept that defines the access a user or group has to resources. Rancher creates several `roleBindings` in the Kubernetes cluster when a user or group is added to a project to enforce proper RBAC controls over projects.\n\nWhen a member is removed from a project, relevant `roleBindings` should be updated. However due to the vulnerability a user that has been removed can still create, update, read, and delete the `namespace` resources, although they cannot access resources (i.e. pods and services) in the `namespaces`.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited through the Rancher UI, API, or through `kubectl` using the `kubeconfig` that users can create in the Rancher UI. If the user was only added to a single project in a cluster and was then removed from that project, they would not see the cluster in the UI or API. If the user previously created and saved a `kubeconfig` for the cluster from the UI, they could still exploit the vulnerability through `kubectl` leading to unauthorized access.",
