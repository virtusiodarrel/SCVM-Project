    "description": "The Gnu Binutils `gold` utility is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the application with a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `File_read::make_view()`, which is defined within `fileread.cc`, is used by the `gold` utility to create a new view of a file. The program accomplishes this by reading data from the file at a specified byte shift. The actual read operation is performed using the `do_read()` function, which will read a number of bytes (specified by the `psize` variable) from the memory location pointed to by `poff` into a dynamically calculated heap buffer location. The dynamically calculated location is performed by adding the value of `byteshift` to `p`, which points to the beginning of a buffer allocated on the heap. The calculation is intended to be performed using unsigned values. However, it is possible to pass the program a crafted file such that this expectation is violated, causing the calculation to resolve to a memory location that lies outside of the boundaries of the utilized memory buffer. This occurs due to the improper validation of the input file's` e_shoff` ELF header field. Whenever the `do_read()` function is called, an out-of-bounds read operation will occur. This will raise an exception and halt program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the application with a crafted file as input, which will trigger the aforementioned chain of events.",
