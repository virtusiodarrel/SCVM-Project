    "title": "Poppler Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Integer Overflow in 'JPXStream::init()' Function",
    "description": "Poppler is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the application with a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `JPXStream::init()`, which is defined in the source file `JPEG2000Stream.cc`, makes use of the `Object` variable `oLen`. This is intended to store an integer value that will be used to obtain the value of the `bufSize` variable, via the evaluation of `oLen.getInt()`. The function will go on to allocate a section of heap memory, the quantity of which is determined using `bufSize`. The value returned by `oLen.getInt()`, which can be positive or negative, is not validated prior to its assignment to `bufSize`. Whenever  the value is used to allocate heap memory, it is interpreted as an unsigned integer. Therefore, if the value initially returned by `oLen.getInt()` was negative, it will be treated as a very large number during the memory allocation process. This will result in an attempt to allocate an excessively large portion of heap memory, which can lead to a program crash. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into opening a crafted `.pdf` file that will trigger the aforementioned chain of events.",
