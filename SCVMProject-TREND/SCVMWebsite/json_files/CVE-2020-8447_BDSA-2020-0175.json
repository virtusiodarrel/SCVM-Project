    "description": "OSSEC-HIDS contains a Use-After-Free vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow authenticated attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or Out-of-bounds Read, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
    "technicalDescription": "There are two situations where a Use-After-Free vulnerability may be able to occur in `analysisd.c`. When a message from the OSSEC queue UNIX domain socket is being processed, the value `lf` is populated with a number of fields as part of the `lf->full_log` buffer.\nThrough this process the message is sent through the syscheck decoder `DecodeSyscheck()` function in `src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c`. The `DB_Search()` function is called which will continue processing the message. The vulnerability occurs due to the situation where either a change is being made to an existing file or there is a new file to track while processing the message. In these situations the `free` function is called on `lf->full_log` and the pointers `lf->log` and `lf->full_log`are set to point at a new message, after which the function returns `1`.\nIn `OS_ReadMSG_analysisd()` function in `analysisd.c` where the `DecodeSyscheck()` function was called from, there is a check on the response from the `DecodeSyscheck()` which is intended to cause the process to jump to `CLMEM`. However due to the return value of `DecodeSyscheck()` being `1` after the `lf` pointers were freed, if the `lf->hostname` or `lf->program_name` are accessed after this point they may access freed memory.\nAn attacker needs to write a valid syscheck message that will have the `program_name` or `hostname` values set by the `OS_CleanMSG()` function to be able to exploit this vulnerability.",
