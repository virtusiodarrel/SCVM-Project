    "title": "Big Blue Button Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Missing Content-Type Header in Presentation Upload Module",
    "description": "Big Blue Button has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to an absence of `Content-Type` header in the presentation upload module. A remote attacker could upload a malicious file containing JavaScript code and steal a victim's session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in `bigbluebutton-web/grails-app/conf/application.groovy` and `bigbluebutton-web/grails-app/controllers/org/bigbluebutton/web/controllers/PresentationController.groovy`. These files do not ensure that the appropriate content type is set for the uploaded presentation files. This could allow an attacker to upload a malicious JavaScript file with an extension allowed by the application (like .png). If a victim user downloads this file and opens it in his browser, the missing `Content-Type` will force the browser to guess the kind of file based on its content. Thus, the malicious code will be executed in the victim's browser.\n\n**Note** The advisory notes that another user named `miztaka` reported this vulnerability first. It also states that it is not explicitly specified in the release notes for the fixed version that the XSS flaw has been fixed.",
