    "title": "Golang Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Permission Mishandling in Windows 'CreateProcess' Function",
    "description": "A permission mishandling vulnerability has been discovered in Golang. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a new process which doesn't declare environment arguments, resulting in the created process inheriting privileges from the parent leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects Go on Windows operating systems.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in Golang which can lead to information exposure. The `createProcess` function implemented in Windows OS is executed with security measures that require additional environment tokens to be declared. This can cause an issue if Go passes a nil environment and non-nil token into the function during the creation of a new process. The new process will be created with the same privilege levels inherited from the parent environment, or a parent environment can become a child of the new process.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute privilege escalation and gain access to sensitive information or overwrite specific settings.",
