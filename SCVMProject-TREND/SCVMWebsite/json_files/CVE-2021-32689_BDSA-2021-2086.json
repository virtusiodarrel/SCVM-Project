    "description": "Nextcloud Talk is vulnerable to information disclosure via the reuse of a previously used username. An attacker could exploit this in order to access and view messages sent to the previous owner of the username.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because it was possible for a previously used username to be reused which subsequently granted access to the messages sent by the original user with that username. It was mitigated by changing the room type so that even in the event that a username is reused it will not allow access to previous conversations.",
