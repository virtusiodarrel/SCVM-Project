    "title": "hostapd Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via IAPP Protocol",
    "description": "It was discovered that hostapd contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this flaw by crafting authentication and association request packets to cause CAM table attacks or traffic flapping either resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs if hostapd has the Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP) protocol enabled which occurs when compiled with default configurations. An attacker could send crafted `Authentication` and `AssociationRequest` packets to hostapd causing the access point to send a broadcast packet with the MAC address of the connecting station to the LAN before the station has been successfully authenticated. \n\nThis could allow the attacker to cause a DoS within the upstream network infrastructure by exhausting the capacity of the CAM table via mimicking a large number of MAC addresses (CAM Table Overflow) or by route flapping, which is achieved by alternately advertising the network routes or availability of already existing clients, connected to other nearby AP's on the same wireless infrastructure in rapid sequence.",
