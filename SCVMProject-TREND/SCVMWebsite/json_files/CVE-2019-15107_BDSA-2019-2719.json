    "title": "Webmin Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Backdoor in 'password_change.cgi' File",
    "description": "Webmin is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to a command injection flaw. Successfully exploiting could allow an attacker to execute malicious commands with root privileges on the vulnerable machine.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).",
    "technicalDescription": "This can be exploited via an existing backdoor which was previously introduced to Webmin, allowing an attacker to deliver a remote command if the password change module is enabled. Only version **1.890** is exploitable in the default install. The vulnerable file is `password_change.cgi` and the component must have `passwd_mode` configured to `2` in `miniserv.conf`. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands by piping in commands when attempting to change a user's password. The username or password does not need to be valid to exploit. \n\nAny systems running a vulnerable version should be considered compromised.\n\nThe developers of Webmin have confirmed that only the official Webmin download packages on the SourceForge repository were affected. GitHub releases are not vulnerable.",
