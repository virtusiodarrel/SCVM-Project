    "title": "Roundcube Webmail Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via 'rcube_image.php'",
    "description": "Roundcube Webmail contains an arbitrary code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this flaw to execute malicious code on the web server.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in `program/lib/Roundcube/rcube_image.php`. This file does not implement sanitization measures for shell metacharacters while handling input from the `im_convert_path` and `im_identify_path` configuration options. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the web server by sending malicious requests to the installer. For example, an attacker could open a reverse shell on the web server by getting a victim user to click on an email containing a malicious image file (which has a non-standard format like TIF). In this scenario, the server will try to convert the TIF file to a standard format like JPG and thus trigger the reverse shell.\n\n**Note** The vendor has classified this vulnerability as a minor one because it only affects Roundcube installations with public access to the installer (which is unlikely in practice).\n\n**Note** The vulnerability has been officially fixed by this commit (https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/fcfb099477f353373c34c8a65c9035b06b364db3) in versions 1.4.4, 1.3.11 and 1.2.10 which can be found here (https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/tags) . However, the fixed code can be bypassed using flag injection and calling remote executables (for Windows only). More information about this bypass vulnerability can be found here (https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/blob/master/CVE-2020-12641-Command%20Injection-Roundcube/Bypasses/Flag%20Injection.md) and here (https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/blob/master/CVE-2020-12641-Command%20Injection-Roundcube/Bypasses/Windows%20SMB%20Paths.md).  \n\nThere's a better fix in versions 1.3.12 and 1.4.5 which were released later.",
