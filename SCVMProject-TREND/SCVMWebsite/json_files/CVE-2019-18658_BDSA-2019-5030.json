    "title": "Helm Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Unsafe Symlink Handling in 'LoadDir' Function",
    "description": "Helm is vulnerable to information disclosure, and denial-of-service (DoS), due to the unsafe handling of symlinks. An attacker could obtain the contents of arbitrary files on a client's computer by tricking them into opening a maliciously crafted chart. They could also cause the application to become unresponsive or crash.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `LoadDir()`, of file `pkg/chartutil/load.go`, contains code that is used to implement Helm's chart symlink functionality. This functionality allows chart dependencies to be loaded from locations pointed to by symlinks. The type of file that a symlink points to is not validated by this function. The linked file will be copied into the archive that is associated with the chart whenever a command such as `helm package` is executed. If the linked file contains sensitive information, this information could be exposed if the archive is moved to a location that is public or to which adversaries have access. Alternatively, if the symlink points to a certain type of special file, such as `/dev/urandom`, the application may attempt to continuously read a large (or infinite) amount of data from the file. This could lead to a DoS. A remote attacker could therefore obtain sensitive information or cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running `helm package` or `helm install` against a maliciously crafted chart.",
