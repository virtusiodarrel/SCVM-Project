    "description": "ksh is vulnerable to arbitrary shell command execution due to a flaw in how some environment variable types are evaluated.\n\nAn attacker could provide a crafted environment variable to allow them to bypass environment restrictions and execute shell commands on the system.",
    "technicalDescription": "ksh is vulnerable to arbitrary shell command execution because environment variables that are expected to contain a number are not sufficiently validated and are evaluated as an arithmetic expression. \n\nThis means an attacker could try to set a specially crafted value in one of these environment variables before a ksh shell is executed and execute arbitrary shell commands before the shell restrictions are in place.",
