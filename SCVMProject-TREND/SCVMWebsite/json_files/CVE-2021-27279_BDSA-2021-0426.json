    "description": "MyBB is vulnerable to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) via nested `[email]` tags. An attacker could exploit this to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's browser, allowing for the theft of session tokens, cookies, and other sensitive information. This may occur if a new message form using instant preview is pre-filled through a `POST` or `GET` parameter, or if a message that was previously saved on the server is displayed.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue was discovered in the `mycode_parse_email` function of the `inc/class_parser.php` file. It occurs because it is possible to include opening and closing square brackets `[`, `]` in the value of the `href=\"\"` attribute of the `<a>` tag within the output of the `[email]` `MyCode`. The can cause further parsing of `MyCode` with un-escaped colliding `\"` characters which could lead to XSS. It was mitigated by the introduction of `$email = $this->encode_url($email)` validation.",
