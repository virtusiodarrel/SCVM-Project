    "title": "Apache OpenOffice Vulnerable to Brute Force Attacks via Weak Master Key Entropy",
    "description": "Apache OpenOffice does not properly encode the master key that is used to encrypt stored passwords for web connections in the user's configuration database. Because of weak entropy in the master key, the stored passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks if an attacker has access to a user's stored configuration.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists because the application does not properly encode the master key that results in its entropy being reduced from 128 bits to 43 bits. This master key is used to encrypt the stored passwords for web connections in the user's configuration database. Because of the weak entropy, these stored passwords become vulnerable to brute force attacks that can be conducted by an attacker who has access to a user's stored configuration.\n\nThis issue has been mitigated by fixing the encoding of the master password by strengthening its entropy.",
