    "title": "DNN Vulnerable to Unauthorized File Disclosure via Message Center Module",
    "description": "It was discovered that DNN contains an information disclosure vulnerability. Due to incorrect permission checks on file attachments in the messages feature, an attacker could send themselves a message and alter the attached file ID to retrieve any file stored in the Admin File Manager. Any files stored in a secure folder is not accessible.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs in the the message center module. An attacker could send themselves a message with a file they uploaded as an attachment, intercept the request and alter the `fileIds` parameter to replace the attached file with any file from the server. The `fileIds` value is incremented each time a file is uploaded onto the server. This can allow an attacker to enumerate any file stored within Admin File Manager, that isn't stored in a secure folder, by entering a file id lower than the one assigned to their file. When intercepting the request the attacker could add multiple file ids to receive multiple files.",
