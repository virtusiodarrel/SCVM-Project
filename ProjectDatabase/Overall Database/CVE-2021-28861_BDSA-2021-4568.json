    "title": "Python Vulnerable to Open Redirects via Improper Handling of '//' Characters",
    "description": "Python is vulnerable to open redirects due to the improper handling of `//` characters. An attacker could cause a victim to inadvertently visit a malicious web page by tricking them into clicking on a crafted link.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability exists within the `parse_request()` function, of file `Lib/http/server.py`. This function fails to sanitize `//` character sequences. If a path starts with such a sequence, then it will be treated as an absolute path by HTTP clients, rather than a relative one. This could allow an attacker to use URIs which contain `//` character sequences in order to trick victims into visiting malicious content.",
