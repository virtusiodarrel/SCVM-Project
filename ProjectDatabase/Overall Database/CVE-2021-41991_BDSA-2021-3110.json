    "description": "strongSwan is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) issue due to the presence of an integer overflow flaw within the in-memory certificate cache.\n\nAn attacker could send multiple requests over a period of time to trigger the overflow flaw and cause an out-of-bounds array access and a double-dereference with a resulting segmentation fault. The vendor has noted that a remote code execution (RCE) outcome cannot be ruled out completely, however,  attackers do not have control over the dereferenced memory, meaning it is highly unlikely.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated [here](https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2021/10/18/strongswan-vulnerability-(cve-2021-41991).html) that installations that don't have the in-memory certificate cache enabled are not vulnerable. However, `charon.cert_cache` is enabled, by default.",
    "technicalDescription": "strongSwan is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions and potential remote code execution (RCE) because the in-memory certificate cache contains an integer overflow flaw. When receiving multiple requests with different certificates, in order to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries the `random()` function is used to select an unpopular cache entry to remove. However, this process is flawed in that a random high value could be returned and cause the index calculation to result in an integer overflow.",
