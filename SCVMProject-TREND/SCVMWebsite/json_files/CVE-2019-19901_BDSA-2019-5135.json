    "title": "Backdrop Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'title' and 'description' Parameters",
    "description": "Backdrop content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the improper sanitization of client-provided input. A remote attacker could execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking them into viewing a maliciously crafted file description. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `description` and `title` parameters due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized payload, then have an administrator execute malicious JavaScript script when configuring a layout.\n\nThe Vendor has addressed this issue by adding `filter_xss()` and `check_plain()` functions in the `core/modules/layout/includes/block.class.inc` and `core/modules/layout/includes/block_legacy.class.inc` files.",
