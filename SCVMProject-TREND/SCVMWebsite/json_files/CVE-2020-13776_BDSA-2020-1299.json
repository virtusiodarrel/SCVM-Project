    "title": "systemd Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Mishandling of Numerical Usernames",
    "description": "systemd is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to the incorrect interpretation of numerical usernames. An attacker could execute certain commands with arbitrary privileges on a vulnerable machine by using a maliciously crafted user name string.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `parse-util.c` contains a variety of functions that are used in the parsing of user names. One of the functions that are called within this file is `strtoul()`, which decodes the user name that has been passed in string argument `s`. If the string contains the prefix `0x`, and the `base` argument has the value zero or sixteen, it will be interpreted as being a hexadecimal number. If `base` is zero and the initial character of the string is `0`, the string will be interpreted as an octal number. This can lead to user names that are composed of decimal digits or have been prefixed with `0x` being associated with the corresponding numerical `uid` value, which can lead to commands being execute with the privileges of that corresponding `uid`. An attacker could therefore use a maliciously crafted user name in order to execute certain commands with arbitrary privileges on a vulnerable machine.",
