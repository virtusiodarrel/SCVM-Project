    "title": "October CMS Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG File Upload",
    "description": "October content management system (CMS) contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Due to insufficient sanitization of SVG files, a privileged attacker with access to the backend could upload a maliciously crafted SVG file containing JavaScript code. The malicious code will then be executed in the victim's browser if the attacker can trick them into viewing the file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient sanitization of SVG files. An attacker could exploit this flaw by injecting malicious scripts into a SVG file and then uploading it to the server. Whilst the code wont execute if viewed via the backend as SVG files aren't displayed inline, if an attacker can trick a victim into following a URL directly linking to the file then the code will be executed in the victim's browser. This vulnerability could be exploited to steal session tokens, cookies, and other sensitive information.\n\nThe issue was addressed by disabling SVG uploads.",
