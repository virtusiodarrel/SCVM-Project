    "description": "Cloud Controller is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the unsafe logging of information that relates to background jobs. An authenticated attacker could retrieve sensitive information relating to those jobs (such as credentials) by accessing the log files.",
    "technicalDescription": "Cloud Controller contains functionality for logging the properties of background jobs. The logs that are produced may contain sensitive information. For example, service broker jobs may be provided with service credentials whenever they are initiated. The environmental variables of applications that are deployed using server-side manifests are another example of sensitive data that may be included in these logs. An authenticated attacker who is entitled to see these logs could recover this sensitive information, which could assist them in conducting additional attacks.\n\nThe vendor has stated that developers should be advised to rotate any credentials that may have been exposed in these logs.",
