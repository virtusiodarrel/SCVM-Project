    "title": "json Ruby Gem Vulnerable to Unsafe Object Creation via JSON Document Parsing",
    "description": "The json gem bundled with Ruby is vulnerable to unsafe object creation due to improper parsing of JSON documents. This could allow an attacker to bypass security protections against creating internal objects in Ruby applications.\n\nNote that this issue exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0269.",
    "technicalDescription": "Improper validation of objects and object attributes in JSON documents, when parsed using certain calls such as `JSON(user_input)` and `JSON.parse(user_input, nil)`, can allow arbitrary Symbol objects to be created. This could bypass security protections against the creation of such objects implemented in Ruby applications.\n\nIn versions prior to **1.7.7**, **1.6.8** and **1.5.5**, the call `JSON.parse(user_input)` is also affected by this vulnerability, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are possible as a large number of symbols could be created which are not garbage-collectible. This was addressed and disclosed as CVE-2013-0269 before it was discovered this was incomplete and a further fix was required.",
