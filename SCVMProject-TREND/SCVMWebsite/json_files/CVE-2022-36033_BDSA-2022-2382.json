    "title": "Jsoup Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Incorrect Sanitization of 'javascript:' URL expressions",
    "description": "Jsoup has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to an absence of correct parameter input validation. A remote attacker could insert JavaScript code into dynamically generated content in order to steal a victim's session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information.\n\n**Note** This vulnerability applies to installations where the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled and the HTML site does not have a Content Security Policy is in place.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists because the application does not correctly sanitize `javascript:` URL expressions before they are parsed by a web browser. Thus, the existing security measures can be bypassed by inserting control characters into the `href` attribute. This will lead to the Java URL class resolving the input as a relative URL instead of an absolute URL. Subsequently, the browser parsing this URL will normalize the inserted control characters and evaluate the expression as a `javascript:` spec inline expression. This could allow an attacker to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code and trick a victim user into clicking on it. Exploitation of this flaw can result in the theft of session tokens and cookies.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in the `src/main/java/org/jsoup/internal/StringUtil.java` file by stripping control characters when resolving absolute URLs.\n\n**Note** This vulnerability is only exploitable in installations where the `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled and the HTML site does not have a Content Security Policy is in place.",
