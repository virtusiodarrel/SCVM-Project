    "title": "OSSEC-HIDS Vulnerable to Path Traversal via 'agent' in Syscheck Decoder",
    "description": "OSSEC-HIDS contains a path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user controlled data. A local attacker with access to write directly to the OSSEC queue could access sensitive information from internal files or internal resources, and potentially interfere with critical system files.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `DB_File()` function in `src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c` uses the value of `agent`, which contains user controlled data, without validation to open a file. The value is used in `snprintf()` to fill `sdb.buf` which is then used to open a file with `fopen` with read and write permissions.\nThe value of `agent` is `lf->location` which is populated by values in the syscheck message controlled by the attacker. When an attacker is remote and is required to use `ossec-remoted` which will automatically ensure the prefix is included in the agent name and the source IP is also included. This means a remote attacker has less control of the agent value.\nIf an attacker has full control of the `lf->location` value such as if they have access to write directly to the OSSEC queue, the attacker can include any filepath in the `agent` value, therefore being able to exploit the vulnerability.",
