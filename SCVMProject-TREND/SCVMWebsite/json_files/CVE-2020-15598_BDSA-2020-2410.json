    "description": "ModSecurity is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. An attacker could exploit this to cause the server to become unresponsive as long as the attack is being delivered.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists due to Modsecurity **3.0.x** changing how regular expression matching works. Rather than quitting the Regex after the first match, any non-anchored regex containing the `capture` action, the documented limit of 10 instances in the TX Variable space is filled, leading to a DoS.\n\nIn previous versions this would have been mitigated by the `SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit` directive, however it was dropped in the **3.0.x** branch.\n\n**Note:** The Vendor does not consider this a security issue as the attacker is unable to create a regex that will exploit this, only use already existing ones, as a result it is not exploitable by default and requires a valid user to add a regex that is exploitable and the attacker would need to know the details of that regex before being able to exploit this.",
