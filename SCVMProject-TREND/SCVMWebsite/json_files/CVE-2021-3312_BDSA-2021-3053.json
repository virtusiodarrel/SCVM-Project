    "title": "Alkacon OpenCMS Vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via SVG Processing Functionality",
    "description": "Alkacon OpenCMS is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to the insecure processing of SVG files. An authenticated attacker with edit permissions could exfiltrate files from a vulnerable server by causing that server to process a maliciously crafted SVG file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `CmsXmlEntityResolver` class, which is defined in the file `src/org/opencms/xml/CmsXmlEntityResolver.java`, contains the `resolveEntity()` method. This method can be invoked by Alkacon OpenCMS in order to evaluate XML entity references that are contained in a document. The method contains `if` statements to handle various reference types. \nIf none of the conditional blocks are executed, then the method will return `null`. This will cause the default behavior to be invoked, which can allow an external entity reference to be resolved. An attacker could provide the application with a crafted document that contains a malicious external entity reference in order to exfiltrate files that are being stored on the machine. The attacker must have access to a user account with edit permissions in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that an exception will be raised if none of the conditional statements in `resolveEntity()` are executed. This prevents the default entity resolution behavior from being invoked.",
