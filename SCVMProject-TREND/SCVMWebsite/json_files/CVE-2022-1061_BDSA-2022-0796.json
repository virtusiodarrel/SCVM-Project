    "title": "Radare2 Vulnerable to Information Exposure via Out-of-Bounds Read in 'parseDragons' Function",
    "description": "Radare2 is vulnerable to information exposure due to the improper accessing of system memory resources. An attacker could potentially recover sensitive information from application memory by tricking a victim into running the application using a maliciously crafted input file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `parseDragons()`, of file `libr/bin/p/bin_symbols.c`, Has several parameters. One of these parameters is `buf`, which is a pointer to a `RBuffer` object. The size of the buffer which is associated with `buf` is stored in the `size` variable. This variable is used in arithmetic operations which are used to access the buffer. The value of `size` is insufficiently validated during these operations, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read event. An attacker could potentially leverage this issue in order to recover sensitive data from the application's memory. It may also be possible for the attacker to crash the application, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).",
