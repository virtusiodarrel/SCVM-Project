    "title": "LibreOffice Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Mishandled 'ShellExecute' Restrictions",
    "description": "LibreOffice is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the possibility of bypassing restrictions that have been placed on dangerous functionality. An attacker could execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer by tricking them into interacting with a maliciously crafted document.\n\nIt should be noted that this vulnerability only affects Windows systems.",
    "technicalDescription": "LibreOffice contains functionality which allows users to follow URIs that have been embedded in a document. On Windows, such URIs can be processed by the `ShellExecute()` function. A denylist is used in an attempt to prevent arbitrary executables from being launched by malicious URIs. This functionality can however be bypassed, meaning that an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on a victim's system by tricking that victim into following a malicious URI that has been embedded in a document.\n\nIt should be noted that this vulnerability only affects Windows systems.",
