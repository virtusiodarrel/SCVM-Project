    "description": "Xen is vulnerable through an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-15565 causing a missed critical operation for memory security. A privileged guest attacker could cause a host wide denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially escalate their privileges.",
    "technicalDescription": "An incomplete fix for CVE-2020-15565 allows x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to achieve unintended read/write DMA access. The problem exists in the `atomic_write_ept_entry()` function in the `xen/arch/x86/mm/p2m-ept.c` file where a flush operation was missed if `level` was different than 0. This can lead to entries in the IOMMU not being properly updated. Read/write DMA access could be retained for frames returned to Xen's free pool which are later reused for another purpose.\n\n**Note** only Intel x86 systems are affected where the guest is using HAP, has a passed through PCI device, and page table sharing is enabled. AMD x86 systems, and Arm systems are unaffected.",
