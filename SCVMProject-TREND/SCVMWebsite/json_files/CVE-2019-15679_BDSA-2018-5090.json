    "description": "TightVNC is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by sending maliciously crafted network packets to the application.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `InitialiseRFBConnection()`, which is defined within the source file `rfbproto.c`, allocates a heap memory buffer that is referenced via the variable `client->desktopName`. This memory is allocated by calling the `malloc()` function, and the variety of memory to be allocated is obtained dynamically via the calculation `client->si.nameLength + 1 `. The value of  `client->si.nameLength` is client controlled, and no validation is performed to ensure that an integer overflow does not occur. An attacker could therefore supply crafted input to force an integer overflow, which will cause too little memory to be allocated on the heap. The function later calls the `ReadFromRFBServer()` function in order to write data to the `client->desktopName` buffer. An attacker could exploit the fact that too little memory has been allocated in order to cause a heap buffer overflow.",
