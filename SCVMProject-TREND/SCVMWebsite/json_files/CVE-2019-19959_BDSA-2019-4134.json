    "title": "SQLite Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Memory Corruption in Multiple Functions",
    "description": "SQLite is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by causing it to process a SQL statement that references a maliciously crafted file name.",
    "technicalDescription": "The file `zipfile.c` contains code that is used by SQLite in order to implement a virtual function table for reading from, and writing to, ZIP archive files.  These files can be written to whenever an`INSERT INTO` statement is evaluated. This file defines a variety of functions, including `zipfileUpdate()` and `zipfileStep()`. These functions manipulate arrays in memory that are intended to store data relating to the name of the file that is being written to by the application. These functions do not take the fact that file names may contain embedded zeros into consideration, which can cause these functions to conduct illegal memory access operations. Such operations will generate exceptions and halt program execution. An attacker could potentially cause a DoS by providing crafted input that will cause SQLite to attempt to write to a file which contains embedded zeros in its filename.",
