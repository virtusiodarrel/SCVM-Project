    "description": "Singularity installations configured to use the Execution Control List (ECL) functionality are vulnerable to running malicious SIF containers due to how image integrity is not correctly validated.\n\nAn attacker could abuse this flaw by submitting a crafted container that will be incorrectly permitted to run.",
    "technicalDescription": "Singularity, when using the Execution Control List (ECL), is vulnerable to malicious SIF container execution because image integrity is not sufficiently validated.\n\nThe fingerprint required by the ECL is compared against the signature object descriptor(s) in the SIF file, rather than to a cryptographically validated signature. This makes it possible for an attacker craft an arbitrary payload which will be permitted to run, even if the attacker does not have access to the private key associated with the fingerprint(s) configured in the ECL.",
