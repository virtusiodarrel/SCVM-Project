    "description": "Rocket.Chat is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious payload in order to steal session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information, as well as  elevate their privileges and modify messages.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists with special message rendering in the `specializedRendering()` function of file `app/message-attachments/client/renderField.js` in Rocket.Chat. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious payload in order to steal session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information, as well as  elevate their privileges and modify messages.\n\nThe vendor has mitigated against this by ensuring the `specializedRendering()` function escapes HTML, in order to sanitize a user supplied input.",
