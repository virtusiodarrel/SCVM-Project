    "description": "GLPI is vulnerable to an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability. Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to read all the files and folders contained in `/files/`.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue was found in the `front/pluginimage.send.php` file. The endpoint is designed to allow a user to supply an image from a plugin. The parameters within this file can be maliciously crafted to delete the .htaccess file for the files directory. This would allow any user to be able to read all the files within the directory, these may include sensitive information such as Administrators session token which could then be used for malicious authentication. \nThis was mitigated by the removal of any plugin file from unauthenticated users, by preventing access to files outside the plugins directories or to files from inactive plugins, and by limiting access to images.",
