    "description": "Advanced Access Manager Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure via REST API. A privileged attacker could exploit this in order to view information that they should not be able to.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue relates to the `aam/v1/authenticate` and `aam/v2/authenticate` REST endpoints as they were configured to reply to a successful login attempt with a json-encoded copy of all metadata about the user. This information included the users hashed password and roles and capabilities and any other custom metadata for other plugins. This metadata could potentially contain sensitive data which could be used to launch further attacks. It was mitigated by ensuring that a controlled array of data is now output so as to avoid information exposure.",
