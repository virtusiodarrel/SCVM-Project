    "title": "BIND Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Assertion Failure in TLS Connections",
    "description": "BIND is vulnerable to an assertion failure if a TLS session is destroyed too early. This can cause the named daemon to terminate, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS). \n\n**Note:** The vendor has stated that vulnerable configurations are those that include a reference to `http` within the listen-on statements in their `named.conf`. TLS is used by both DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH), but configurations using DoT alone are unaffected.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists when a TLS connection to a configured http TLS listener, which has a defined endpoint, is destroyed too early. This can cause the named daemon to terminate, causing a denial-of-service (DoS). \n\nThe vendor has mitigated against this by ensuring that the `tlslisten_acceptcb()` and `tcp_connected()` functions of `lib/isc/netmgr/tlsstream.c` hold a reference to `tlssock` in the TCP socket, as the TLS socket can't be destroyed until its underlying TCP socket is. This is subsequently detached in `isc__nm_tls_cleanup_data()` of file `lib/isc/netmgr/tlsstream.c`. This means that the TLS stream socket cannot be destroyed too early, avoiding the assertion failure.",
