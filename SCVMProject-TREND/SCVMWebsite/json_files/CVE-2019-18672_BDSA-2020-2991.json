    "title": "ShapeShift KeepKey Vulnerable to Account Lockout and Authentication Bypass via Mnemonic Wipe",
    "description": "ShapeShift KeepKey is vulnerable to account lockout and authentication bypass due to a mnemonic wipe flaw. An authenticated attacker could lock a user out of their account by successfully invalidating existing `U2F` login configurations, or could bypass `U2F` protections by creating a new server registration.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue exists in the `recovery_character` and `recovery_cipher_finalize` method within the `lib/firmware/recovery_cipher.c` file. Successful exploitation could allow the mnemonic seed to be wiped which would result in the device deriving  addresses from `null` mnemonic seed causing `U2F` websites to fail to authenticate. It was mitigated by the addition of stronger recovery state checks.",
