    "description": "TightVNC is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `HandleZlibBPP()`, which is defined within `zlib.c`, contains code that is used by TightVNC to manage data that has been encoded by `zlib`. This function will call `malloc()` in order to allocate a heap memory buffer, a pointer to which will be stored in the `client->raw_buffer` variable. The argument that is passed to `malloc()`, denoted by the variable `client->raw_buffer_size`, is derived from client-provided input. The value returned by `malloc()` is not validated to ensure that the memory was allocated as intended. If `client->raw_buffer_size` is too large, `malloc()` will fail and return `NULL`. Whenever the program later tries to use `client->raw_buffer`, a null pointer dereference event will occur. This will raise an exception and halt program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by passing crafted input to the application such that `client->raw_buffer_size` is large enough to make `malloc()` return `NULL`.",
