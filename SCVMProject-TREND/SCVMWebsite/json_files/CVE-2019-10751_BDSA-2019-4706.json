    "title": "HTTPie Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download via Filename Generation after Redirect",
    "description": "HTTPie is vulnerable to an arbitrary file download issue due to how output filenames are generated when `--download` requests are performed without explicitly supplying a filename.\n\nAn attacker, in control of the file hosting server, could return a response to the request that redirects to another URL where in a potentially malicious file is downloaded to the requesting system. This could allow the attacker to perform further attacks depending on the type of file downloaded.",
    "technicalDescription": "HTTPie is vulnerable to an arbitrary file download issue because filenames generated when performing `--download` requests, without providing a filename with `--output` or `-o`, use the final URL in a response even after a redirect has occurred. This means that the downloaded filename can differ from the requested one.\n\nThis issue could allow an attacker to download arbitrary or malicious files to a system when a safe file is requested. Depending on the downloaded file, this issue could lead to other attacks such as code execution or privilege escalation.",
