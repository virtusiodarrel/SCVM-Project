    "title": "curl Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via 'Control-Bytes' in Cookies",
    "description": "Curl is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) issue due to how some HTTP(s) servers handle cookies that contain 'control-bytes' / 'control codes' (byte values below 32). \n\nWhen curl sends cookies that contain these bytes to an HTTP(s) server, it may return a 400 response which effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings.",
    "technicalDescription": "Curl itself accepts cookies that contain ASCII 'control-bytes' / 'control codes' when retrieving and parsing cookies from HTTP(s) servers. The issue occurs when such cookies are sent back to a server. Depending on the server implementation, it is possible for requests to be refused and 400 responses to be issued. While this curl behavior was introduced in **4.9**, the vendor has noted [here](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-35252.html) that it did not cause problems at the time, and only became a problem later when HTTP(s) servers started refusing such requests.\n\nIn order to remedy this issue, the vendor has updated the `Curl_cookie_add()` function in the `lib/cookie.c` file to check if a given cookie contains the specified bytes within the name or value of the cookie and to drop it if so.",
