    "title": "Pydio Cells Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbitrary 'Sendmail' Binaries",
    "description": "Pydio Cells allows arbitrary binaries to be executed when `Sendmail` has been configured as the default mailing application. An attacker with admin-level privileges could exploit this flaw to cause remote code execution (RCE).",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists because `Sendmail` option allows for arbitrary files to be selected for execution. An attacker who can access the admin console could configure `Sendmail` as the default email option. Then, the attacker could specify a malicious binary to be executed from an arbitrary path because there are no restrictions in place. This could result in remote code execution.\nAs shown in the PoC, an attacker could change the binary path to `/usr/bin/awk`. Then, they could send a request to create a new user `userce` and edit the `email` field in the request to contain a Unicode-encoded payload that opens a reverse shell. Lastly, the attacker will send an email to this newly created user which will then create the reverse shell to the attacker's server. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
