    "description": "Pluck Content Management System (CMS) is vulnerable to a remote command execution flaw. A remote, authenticated attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary commands on the host.",
    "technicalDescription": "By uploading a file called `.htaccess.txt` an attacker can turn the existing `.htaccess` file into a `.txt` file. They can then delete the `.htaccess.txt` file, disabling the access control provided by this file and allowing them to upload a shell. \n\nThis issue was mitigated through two additional checks in the `deletefile.php` file. The first one prevents an upload if the name of the uploaded file is `.htaccess`. The second check ensures there isn't an item with the same name as the uploaded file in the trashcan.",
