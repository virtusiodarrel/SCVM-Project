    "title": "set-value Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via 'set' Function",
    "description": "set-value is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to insufficient input validation.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify the Object prototype properties which causes additional properties or changes to the objects which could result in denial-of-service (DoS) or alter the integrity of the application. If the application uses polluted objects in conjunction with code execution primitives (such as eval), it may be possible for an attacker to execute malicious code.\n\nIt was later determined that this issue could be bypassed via a type confusion vulnerability as noted in **CVE-2021-23440** (**BDSA-2021-2911**).",
    "technicalDescription": "The `set` function in `index.js` does not validate input that can used to modify the `Object` prototype.  An attacker that is able to include crafted input into this function using `constructor`, `prototype` or `__proto__`, could exploit this vulnerability to modify properties of the objects.  This can be used to cause a denial-of-service (DoS), or to alter the integrity of the application, when a modified property is later called in the code. This type of vulnerability can potentially be used to cause code execution if the polluted object is used in conjunction with `eval()` or other code execution primitives, command line arguments or environment variables for spawned applications.",
