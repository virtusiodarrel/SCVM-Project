    "title": "Nextcloud Server Vulnerable to Malicious File Download via Missing Escaping in 'DownloadResponse'",
    "description": "Nextcloud Server fails to escape filenames by default in controllers that utilize `DownloadResponse`. An attacker could exploit this in order to trick users in to downloading malicious files which would display with a file extension such as `.jpeg` but be downloaded with an executable file extension such as `.exe`.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `__construct()` function of the `lib/public/AppFramework/Http/DownloadResponse.php` file due to lack of escaping of filenames. It was mitigated by amending the function with the introduction of `string` and by the introduction of escaping through the addition of the following line of code `$filename = strtr($filename, ['\"' => '\\\\\"', '\\\\' => '\\\\\\\\']);`.",
