    "title": "Redhat Wildfly Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Incorrect Caller Principal Return",
    "description": "Redhat Wildfly contains an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this issue by setting the `incomingRunAsIdentity` field as a `SecurityIdentity`. This would eventually lead to an attacker being able to read sensitive information without relevant authorization.\n\n**Note:** JBoss EAP 7.1 up to 7.4 is not affected by default due to out-of-the-box enabled legacy security.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue can be exploited in a concurrent environment, where the wrong caller principal can be returned by multiple users which repeatedly invoke an `EJB` that is configured with a `RunAs` principal. As well as `incomingRunAsIdentity`, it is also possible for `getCallerPrincipal` and `isCallerInRole` to return the wrong caller principal, leading to the same disclosure of information.",
