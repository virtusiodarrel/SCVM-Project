    "description": "osTicket is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw. A remote attacker who can log into the customer portal can leverage this to perform port scanning, amongst other attacks.",
    "technicalDescription": "In the \"Print\" functionality, within the \u201cPost a Reply\u201d section, an attacker can craft input such as `<img src=\u201chttps://attacker.com\u201d>`. Once the print button is pressed and the request processed by the server, the server will attempt to fetch the remote URL, leading to a server-side request forgery (SSRF). This can be used to perform port scanning. It could also lead to the loading of dangerous file types within a victim's browser.\n\nThe issue has been resolved by supporting a configuration option that can disable the loading of external images. Also, if loaded images are allowed, the file types are restricted to valid image files only.",
