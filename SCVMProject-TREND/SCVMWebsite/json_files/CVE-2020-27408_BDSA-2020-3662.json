    "title": "OpenSIS Community Edition Vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change via Improper Access Control in 'ResetUserInfo.php'",
    "description": "OpenSIS Community Edition has an improper access control for its password change functionality via `ResetUserInfo.php`. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to change the password of any user.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in the `ResetUserInfo.php` file which handles the password change functionality. Because of lack of access control for this functionality, an unauthenticated attacker can use a brute-force attack on the `user_info` variable which determines the user. This variable consists of two comma-separated integer values corresponding to `user_id` and `profile_id` which basically identify a user. Thus, the attacker can brute-force these integer values and then change the password of any user. \n\nThis vulnerability was originally fixed by [this](https://github.com/OS4ED/openSIS-Responsive-Design/commit/edca0855e7bc27d5b28dcb2d16f057ada865e282) commit. In this commit, an obfuscation mechanism was introduced for the variables `user_id` and `profile_id`. These variables were wrapped inside the `cryptor()` function which performed the obfuscation using remapping techniques. But this did not really address the authorization issue. Also, some other code added within the `AuthCryp.php` file lead to a remote code execution vulnerability wherein an attacker could employ the PHP `exec()` function with three optional parameters to execute malicious code.\n\nLater on, upon being notified about the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, the vendor removed the vulnerable code with [this](https://github.com/OS4ED/openSIS-Responsive-Design/commit/c1b427f76f78f1ee2bab50c8e6bd8a38e4ed6bab).",
