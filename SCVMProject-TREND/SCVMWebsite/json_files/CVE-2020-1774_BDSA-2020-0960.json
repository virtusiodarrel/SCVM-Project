    "title": "OTRS Vulnerable to Information Exposure via PGP or S/MIME Exported Files",
    "description": "OTRS contains an information exposure vulnerability due to exported files of sensitive information having the same name as files intended to be public. This could result in a user sharing their sensitive private key with a third party instead of the intended public key. An attacker could exploit this issue if they were sent the private key to obtain sensitive information from any data sent using the related public key.",
    "technicalDescription": "The export file functionality for PGP or S/MIME keys/certificates does not differentiate between the private and public keys in the file names. This makes it possible for a user to accidentally share their private key instead of the intended public key with a third party. Once the private key is in the hands of an attacker it is possible for the attacker to decrypt any data encrypted with the relevant public key. \nThis issue exists in the `Run` functions in `Kernel/Modules/AdminPGP.pm` and `Kernel/Modules/AdminSMIME.pm` files.",
