    "description": "Nextcloud Server is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to the improper enforcement of permissions that relate to federated reshares. A remote authenticated attacker could potentially view shared files and folders to which they should not have access.",
    "technicalDescription": "Nextcloud Server's federated sharing functionality is implemented using the `CloudFederationProviderFiles` class, which is defined in the file `apps/federatedfilesharing/lib/OCM/CloudFederationProviderFiles.php`. This functionality allows users to share files and folders with other users within that Nextcloud Server instance. \n\nA user that is the recipient of a share can choose to re-share it with another user. This functionality is implemented via the `reshareRequested()` method, which processes re-share requests that have been generated by users. Part of this process involves validating the permissions that relate to the share. Servers can be configured with a set of permissions that should be applied to shares by default. The `reshareRequest()` method fails to ensure that these permissions are applied to federated re-shares that are being processed. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to access data that they are not authorized to access. The attacker must trick a victim into sharing a resource of interest in order to achieve this.",
