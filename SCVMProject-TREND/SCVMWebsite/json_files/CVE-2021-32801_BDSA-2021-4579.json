    "title": "Nextcloud Server Vulnerable to Logging of Sensitive Information of 'Encryption-at-Rest' Key Material",
    "description": "Nextcloud Server is vulnerable to an information logging issue due to how the exception logging code can log potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality.\n\nAn attacker with access to the logs could abuse this information in order to launch further attacks against encrypted material.\n\n**Note**: If you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.",
    "technicalDescription": "To remedy this issue, the vendor has added a series of Encryption-at-Rest related methods to the `methodsWithSensitiveParametersByClass` list in the `lib/private/Log/ExceptionSerializer.php` file in order to exclude sensitive material from logs.",
