    "title": "Firefox Vulnerable to Inadvertent Code Execution via Automatic Execution Behavior in Download Open Functionality",
    "description": "Firefox is vulnerable to the inadvertent execution of code due to the implementation of its downloaded file opening functionality. A remote attacker could execute malicious Python code on a victim's computer by tricking them into trying to download and read a crafted script. It should be noted that only Windows systems are affected.",
    "technicalDescription": "A flaw exists within the Firefox feature that allows users to open downloaded files. If a Python file with a MIME type of `text/plain` has been downloaded, the code contained within that file will automatically be executed when the file is opened. The `Open` option should instead cause the code text within the file to be displayed. A remote attacker could therefore cause malicious Python code to be inadvertently executed by a victim if they can trick the victim into opening a Python file that the attacker has served with a MIME type of `text/plain`.",
