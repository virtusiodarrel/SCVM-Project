    "title": "RPM Vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature via 'Subkey Binding Signatures' Functionality",
    "description": "RPM contains an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability due to the failure to validate binding signatures subkeys. If an attacker is able to add or convince another party to add a malicious subkey to a legitimate public key, this could cause RPM to wrongly trust a malicious signature resulting in a loss of data integrity.",
    "technicalDescription": "OpenPGP subkeys are associated with a primary key via a binding signature. The issue occurs due to a flaw in the signature functionality, RPM does not check the validity of a binding signature of subkeys before importing them which could potentially result in a signature being wrongly trusted. \n\nThe issue was addressed by requiring all subkeys to be followed by a binding signature by the primary key\nas per the OpenPGP RFC.\n\nThe vendor states: To exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted RPM or public key.",
