    "title": "OpenSSL Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via Diffie-Hellman Ciphersuite Secret Exposure",
    "description": "OpenSSL is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to an exploitable flaw in the TLS specification with Diffie-Hellman based ciphersuites. This could allow an attacker to obtain shared secrets from targeted communications using timing attacks.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness exists in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange process when establishing TLS connections (specification versions **1.2** and below). Under this specification all leading zero bytes are stripped from the pre-master secret key, which is input to a key derivation function with different timing profiles depending on the input. This could enable timing attacks and allow an attacker to deduce this shared secret for a particular client-server connection, if the following conditions are met:\n* the server reuses public keys in the TLS handshake - either through a configured static cipher suite, or explicit reuse of ephemeral keys in an ephemeral ciphersuite,\n* the attacker is in close proximity to the server in order to perform precise timing analysis.\n\nThe vendor states that the impact to OpenSSL depends on the version in use:\n* Versions **1.1.1** and above are not vulnerable to this issue,\n* Versions from **1.0.2f** up to **1.1.1** are only vulnerable if a static Diffie-Hellman ciphersuite is configured,\n* Versions **1.0.2e** and below are vulnerable with either static Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites, or ephemeral ciphersuites if the `SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE` option is not explicitly configured.\n\nThe vendor states that premium support customers of OpenSSL **1.0.2** should upgrade to **1.0.2w**. **1.0.2** and **1.1.0** releases are out of support and no longer receiving public updates.",
