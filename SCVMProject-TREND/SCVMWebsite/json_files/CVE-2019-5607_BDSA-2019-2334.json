    "description": "FreeBSD is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to the mismanagement of the privileges transmission process. A local attacker could obtain root privileges, or execute a jailbreak, by manipulating the rights transmission control structure in memory.",
    "technicalDescription": "FreeBSD contains functionality that allows for the transmission of rights between processes, via UNIX-domain sockets. These rights are encapsulated in control messages. This process is managed by code that is contained in the script `uipc_usrreq.c`, via functions such as `unp_init()` and `unp_internalize()` . The rights to be transferred are encoded as file descriptors. A variety of variables are used to store values related to this process, such as the file description pointer `fdesc` and  the memory buffer `controlp`. If the rights transmission process fails, the references to the in-memory resources are not released correctly and are leaked. An attacker can manipulate these resources, such as by overflowing the reference counter, to escalate their privileges or escape from a jail.",
