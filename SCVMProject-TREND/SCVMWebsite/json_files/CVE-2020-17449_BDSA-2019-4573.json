    "title": "PHP-Fusion Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'error_log ' Functionality",
    "description": "PHP-Fusion contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within its blog post functionality. Attackers could exploit this by executing malicious scripts in the browser of a victim by tricking them into clicking on a crafted link. This can result in the theft of sensitive information such as authentication tokens and session cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability occurs within the `error_log ` functionality of the application. Authenticated attackers could exploit this by using the editing option of a blog post to store a malicious payload as an error file. Error files are used to notify the admin of issues, resulting in rendering the stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on any page the admin visits with the `error_log` functionality implemented, as long as the affected user\u2019s session is active.",
