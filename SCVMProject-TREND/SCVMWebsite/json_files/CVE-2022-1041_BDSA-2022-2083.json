    "description": "Zephyr is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write flaw that can be triggered during provisioning. An attacker within range of the device could cause controllable memory corruption with unspecified impacts.",
    "technicalDescription": "The problem exists in file `subsys/bluetooth/mesh/pb_adv.c`. In function `gen_prov_start()`there is no check for a mismatched `SegN` and `TotalLength` in Transaction Start PDU. This can later lead to a out-of-bounds write via a `memcpy` routine.\n\nThe issue was resolved by assuring the provided `SegN` provided in the Transaction Start PDU is equal to the number of segments needed to send a Provisioning PDU with `TotalLength` size.",
