    "description": "Xpdf is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the program with a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `PSOutputDev::setupResources()`, defined within `PSOutputDev.cc`, uses the value of `ref0.num` as an index into the array `visitedResources`. The value located at this index is assigned to the variable `skip`. The `ref0` structure is created using the function `gsRef.getRef()`. No checks are performed on the value of the `num` element within this structure to ensure that it is not less than zero, or that it does not exceed the number of objects that have been generated (these objects are structures in memory that are used during the processing of a given PDF file). The `num` element can hold these values whenever certain input PDF files are being processed. This will cause the indexing operation to constitute a null pointer dereference. This will raise an exception, halting program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a denial-of-service by tricking a victim using a crafted PDF file as input which will cause this chain of events to occur.",
