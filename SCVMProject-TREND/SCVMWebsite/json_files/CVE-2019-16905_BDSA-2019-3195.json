    "description": "OpenSSH is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. A remote attacker could cause an instance of the application to crash by uploading a malicious key via a key management service. It should be noted that the vulnerable functionality is experimental and is not included in default configurations.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `sshkey_xmss_decrypt_state()`, which is defined within the script `sshkey-xmss.c`, contains code that is used by OpenSSH in order to implement experimental quantum-safe XMSS (Extended Hash-Based Signatures) key handling functionality. \n\nThis function will call `sshbuf_reserve()` in order to allocate a buffer in memory. The amount of memory allocated will depend on the sum of the variables `authlen` and `encrypted_len`. It is assumed that this sum will not return a value that is larger than that which is specified by the `INT_MAX` macro variable. However, there is insufficient validation to ensure that this is the case. It is possible for the sum of these values to be larger than `INT_MAX`, which will cause an integer overflow to occur. This means that the memory buffer allocated by `sshbuf_reserve()` will be too small. Whenever the application attempts to write data to this buffer, a buffer overflow will occur. This can lead to an exception being raised, halting program execution. \n\nAn attacker can trigger this situation by providing the application with crafted SSH keys; this can be done using a key management service. It should be noted that this functionality is experimental and is not enabled in any default OpenSSH configuration.",
