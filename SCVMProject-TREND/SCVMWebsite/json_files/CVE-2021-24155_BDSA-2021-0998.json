    "title": "WordPress Backup and Migrate Plugin Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbitrary File Upload due to Improper Validation of File Uploads",
    "description": "WordPress Backup and Migrate Plugin does not properly validate the uploaded files to check if they have the `SGBP` format and extension. An attacker having high privileges could exploit this flaw to cause remote code execution (RCE).",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in multiple files that handle file uploads. These files do not check if an uploaded file has an `SGBP` format and extension. This could allow an attacker with admin-level privileges to upload arbitrary files and execute malicious code on the server. Usually, the `.htaccess` file has a protection in place against access for these uploaded files. Thus, web servers that don't support `.htaccess` are vulnerable against this attack. Furthermore, it's possible for an attacker to append arbitrary content to the `.htaccess` file and bypass the access protection by making the `deny from all` rule invalid. This has been demonstrated in the PoC.\n\n**Note** The fix ensures that uploaded files have the `.sgbp` extension. However, it doesn't validate the contents of the file uploads. This could allow an attacker to chain this issue with other ones like LFI or Arbitrary File Renaming and still achieve RCE.",
