    "title": "Jupyter Notebook and Hub Vulnerable to Open Redirect via Insufficient Validation in '_redirect_safe()' Function",
    "description": "Jupyter Notebook and Hub are vulnerable to open redirects due to the insufficient validation of the contents of URIs. An attacker could make a victim navigate to a malicious web page by tricking them into clicking on a crafted link.",
    "technicalDescription": "Jupyter Notebook and Hub attempt to validate redirect URIs included within requests using code contained within the ` _redirect_safe()` function, which is defined within `login.py`. This validation was introduced as a mitigation for a previously discovered open redirect vulnerability. However, this code does not take into account some of the ways in which this redirection can occur. If the `netloc` component of the parsed URI is empty, the application can end up erroneously treating the first part of the specified path as the `netloc` component instead. This could allow an attacker to supply a crafted URI that will bypass the URI validation process, and will still lead the client to a malicious domain. \n\nAn attacker could therefore cause a victim to visit a malicious resource by tricking them into clicking on a crafted link.",
