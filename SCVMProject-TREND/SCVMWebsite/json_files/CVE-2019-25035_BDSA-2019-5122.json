    "title": "Unbound Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Out-of-Bounds Write in 'sldns/parse.c'",
    "description": "An out-of-bounds write has been discovered in Unbound. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted file to achieve remote code execution (RCE).",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `sldns_bget_token_par()` function of the `sldns/parse.c` file, which returns a token from a buffer. Certain inputs may result in a write and subsequent increment of the token buffer without first checking the boundary limits. If this were to be carried out repeatedly then an out of bounds write would occur resulting in unexpected behavior and potentially allowing an attacker to achieve RCE. It was mitigated by expanding the checks within `sldns_bget_token_par()`, including the addition of a check relating to the `space` character.",
