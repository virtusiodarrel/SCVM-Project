    "title": "Ruby on Rails Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Missing Content Security Policy Header in 'Action Pack' API Responses",
    "description": "Ruby on Rails has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to an absence of correct parameter input validation. A remote attacker could insert JavaScript code and steal a victim's session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability lies in the `Action Pack` component of the application. It exists because the application does not send the `Content Security Policy (CSP)` header for non-HTML responses. This could allow an attacker to insert and execute malicious JavaScript code in a victim's browser through API responses. Exploitation of this flaw could result in theft of session tokens and cookies.\n\nThis vendor fixed this issue by allowing `CSP` to be sent with non-HTML responses.",
