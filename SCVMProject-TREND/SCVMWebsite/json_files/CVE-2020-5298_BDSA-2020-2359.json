    "description": "October content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability is exploitable via a user who has \"Allowed to import and export posts\" permissions. If an attacker can trick this user into importing a crafted CSV file into the application, an XSS payload will be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to any arbitrary action that the user has the permissions to carry out being executed. The worst case scenario would occur if an admin user was targeted.",
