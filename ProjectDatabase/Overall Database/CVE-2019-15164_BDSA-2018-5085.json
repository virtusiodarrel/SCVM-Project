    "title": "libpcap Vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Handling in 'daemon_msg_open_req()' Function",
    "description": "libpcap is vulnerable to server side request forgery (SSRF) due to the improper handling of input that refers to remote devices. An attacker could cause the application to open a device on their behalf by providing a URI that refers to that device as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `rpcapd_recv()`, which is defined within the script `daemon.c`, contains code that is used by tcpdump in order to open a handle to a client-specified capture device. The device to be opened is denoted by the `source` variable. The capture device is intended to be local. However, it is possible for a client to give a URI as a source. The application will then attempt to open a connection to the device that corresponds to that URI. An attacker could therefore cause the application to attempt to open a connection to a remote device on their behalf by giving the application a URI instead of the name of a local device. This constitutes a SSRF attack vector.",
