    "title": "Nextcloud Server Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Read-Only Shared Folders",
    "description": "Nextcloud Server contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient checks on re-shared sub-folders. This could allow an attacker to gain privileges to create, edit or delete files that they should only have read-only access to.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `updateShare()` function in  `apps/files_sharing/lib/Controller/ShareAPIController.php` does not sufficiently check that a user has the relevant permissions to update the permissions of a shared sub-folder. An attacker who has been shared a folder, could re-share each sub-folder within that folder to `read-only public` and then use the sharing API to update the permissions of these publicly shared sub-folders to provide create and update permissions. This could allow an attacker to change the contents of the sub-folder when the original folder was shared with read-only access.",
