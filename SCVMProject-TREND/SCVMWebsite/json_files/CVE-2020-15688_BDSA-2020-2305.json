    "description": "GoAhead Web Server is vulnerable to authentication bypass via replay attack. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this to bypass authentication via capture-replay. \n\n**Note:** This issue occurs when using Digest authentication over HTTP. When used over HTTPS, replay should not be possible.",
    "technicalDescription": "Digest authentication utilizes a nonce value to mitigate replay attacks. This value was set to a fixed duration of five minutes which was too long for most implementations and allowed short-period replays to be carried out. After upgrading `ME_GOAHEAD_NONCE_DURATION` should be configured to a suitable duration for your needs. \n\nPer the vendor: \n> Embedthis strongly discourages the use of Digest (and Basic) authentication. They are inherently insecure due to the requirement to store unhashed passwords on the system, insecure MD5 encryption and the fact you cannot reliably implement logout in browsers. Instead, use form / HTTP based authentication over HTTPS with suitable encryption of passwords.",
