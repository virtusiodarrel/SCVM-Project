    "description": "ChakraCore is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of ChakraCore to crash by tricking them into opening a crafted web page or file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `GlobOpt::ProcessFieldKills()`, which is defined within `GlobOptFields.cpp`,  is used by the ChakraCore scripting engine to handle in-memory objects. This object may contain the component `currentBlock`, which in turn contains the variable `globOptData.maybeWrittenTypeSyms`. This variable is intended to store a pointer to a memory buffer. If this pointer is `null`, type confusion can occur whenever the function `GlobOpt::FinishOptPropOp()` is evaluated. This function performs operations on objects that are highly dependent on their type, such as the destruction of certain type symbols. As a result of this, unexpected or unusual object states can trigger type confusion. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into visiting a crafted web site or opening a crafted file that will trigger the faulty object handling logic. It is reported that remote code execution is a potential outcome of this memory corruption, however no evidence of such an exploit is readily available.",
