    "description": "SquirrelMail is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficiently sanitized HTML. This could allow an attacker to execute malicious code and access authentication tokens, cookies, and other sensitive information",
    "technicalDescription": "SquirrelMail has a HTML mode that allows the user to view a received email in HTML format. HTML mode is not enabled by default. It includes a custom sanitization blacklist, which does not handle `RCDATA` and `RAWTEXT` properly. Elements such as `<NOEMBED>` tags are treated as part of title attributes, which results in a lack of sanitization. An attacker could deliver a payload within these tags and execute malicious JavaScript code.  A victim of this attack would need to view the incoming email in HTML mode.",
