    "description": "Microweber is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via relative directory traversal in `Utils/Unzip`. An authenticated attacker with admin privileges could exploit this by uploading a malicious ZIP file.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue relates to the `extract`, `native_unzip`, and `_load_files_by_signatures` functions within the `src/MicroweberPackages/Utils/Zip/Unzip.php` file. It occurs because when a backup file is restored the file name of extracted files are not sanitized. This can therefore permit a directory traversal attack. \n\nThe endpoint required to successfully carry out this attack `/api/Microweber/Utils/Backup/restore` is limited to admin user so admin privileges are required. A malicious file can then be created for upload before being uploaded via the `/plupload` endpoint. At this point it is necessary to know the webroot as the next step requires an absolute path. When this is complete `/api/Microweber/Utils/Backup/move_uploaded_file_to_backup` can be utilized to move the uploaded file to backup so that it can be extracted in order to exploit the vulnerability. This is carried out using the previously mentioned `/api/Microweber/Utils/Backup/restore` with the file id to trigger extraction of the zip file. As the directory which contains the extracted files is a standard, consistent depth of four from the root then a corresponding directory traversal will yield the webroot. The attacker can now download and execute further exploits via `shell_exec` or by uploading a PHP reverse shell directly. \n\nThe issue was mitigated by the introduction of sanitization relating to the use of  `..`.",
