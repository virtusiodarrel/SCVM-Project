    "description": "BigBlueButton Greenlight is vulnerable to account takeover via HTTP header (`Host `and `Origin`) attacks. An attacker could successfully exploit this via a phishing attack.",
    "technicalDescription": "Exploitation of this vulnerability is achieved through request capturing when the `Forgot Password` form is submitted. The `Host` and `Origin` headers can then be replaced with malicious domains. The victim then receives a password reset email which when clicked opens up a link in the browser. There are two possible attack mechanisms, in the first the attacker is able to capture the victim's password reset token and use it to create a random password which will in turn lock the victim out of their account. In the second attack the attacker can create a fake password reset portal in order to capture the new password chosen by the victim. This would allow for account takeover without locking the victim out. It could also allow the attacker to mount further attacks if the victim has used the same password elsewhere. \n\nThis was mitigated by the addition of a `SAFE_HOSTS` env variable that blocks unknown hosts.",
