    "title": "OpenBSD Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via Incorrect '-schallenge' Username Handling",
    "description": "OpenBSD is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to logic flaws when handling the authentication process for the `-schallenge` user name. A remote attacker could authentic to various services on a vulnerable system using crafted requests.",
    "technicalDescription": "OpenBSD implements its own authentication mechanism, called BSD Authentication. Configuration information relating to this authentication mechanism is stored in the file `login.conf`. The authentication process itself is handled using the program that corresponds to the authentication style specified in `login.conf`. One such program is `login_passwd`. This program can accept a user name and a variety of options as input. One such option is `-s`, which specifies the protocol to be used. One protocol that can be used is `challenge`, which will automatically evaluate successfully, as `passwd` style authentication is not challenge-response based. A remote attacker can therefore authenticate successfully to a variety of services by using `-schallenge` as a user name, which takes advantage of this automatically successful evaluation.\n\nServices that have been demonstrated to be vulnerable include `smtpd`, `ldapd` and `radiusd`. This method is ineffective against the `sshd` service due to its defense-in-depth mechanism.",
