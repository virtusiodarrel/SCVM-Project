    "title": "CMS Made Simple Vulnerable to Self Cross-Site Scripting (Self-XSS) via 'Manage Shortcuts' Feature",
    "description": "CMS Made Simple is vulnerable to a self cross-site scripting (self-XSS) issue due to a lack of sufficient input sanitization in the `Manage Shortcuts` feature.\n\nAn attacker could trick an administrative user into copying and pasting malicious content into the `Title` field found in the `Manage Shortcuts`/`Add Shortcut` feature in order to steal the victim administrative user's session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated in a comment on the issue report [here](http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/bug/view/12325), that while this issue is valid they will not fix the issue because \"it will only address the user who exploits this vulnerability\". They have also stated that they \"will work towards a better solution in the future\". According to the [Report a Vulnerability](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/community/get-involved/report-a-vulnerability) page, the vendor does not consider \"the ability to include scripts in any field in the backend, or the uploading of certain file types via the File Manager, to be legitimate vulnerabilities.\"",
    "technicalDescription": "CMS Made Simple is vulnerable to self cross-site scripting (self-XSS) because the `Title` field that is used to define a new 'Shortcut' is not sufficiently sanitized. This field is accessible by administrative users within the `Manage Shortcuts`  feature.\n\nA malicious script inserted in this field can be triggered against the submitting user upon selecting the `Submit` option and viewing the preview of the 'Shortcut'.",
