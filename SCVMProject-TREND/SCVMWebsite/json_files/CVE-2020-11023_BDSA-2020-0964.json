    "title": "jQuery Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via '<option>' Elements in DOM Manipulation Methods",
    "description": "It was discovered that jQuery could allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to be introduced if certain HTML is passed to Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation methods. Attackers could exploit XSS vulnerabilities to execute JavaScript code in a target browser by tricking them into accessing the vulnerable page. This would allow an attacker to steal an administrator's session tokens or execute arbitrary code on their behalf by sending the link to an unsuspecting user or waiting for them to discover it.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability arises when HTML `<option>` elements are passed to DOM manipulation methods (such as `.html()`, `.append()`) that use  `.htmlPrefilter` method and comes from the fact that `.htmlPrefilter` is affected by an XSS issue, described more in detail in **BDSA-2020-0686**.",
