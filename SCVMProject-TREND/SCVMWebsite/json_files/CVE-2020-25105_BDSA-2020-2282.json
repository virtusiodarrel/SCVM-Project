    "title": "Eramba Vulnerable to Password Recovery Brute Force via Weak Recovery Token",
    "description": "It was discovered that Eramba was vulnerable to password recovery brute force attacks due to the use of a weak recovery token. An attacker that has discovered the URL generated by the password recovery functionality of a local account could brute force the token. The attacker could potentially use this to gain access to that account.",
    "technicalDescription": "The issue occurs due to the use of a random six character token created by the `createHash()` function. There is a 24-\nhour validation period associated with this token. An attacker that knows the URL could brute force the token. This vulnerability only affects implementations using local accounts. The issue was addressed by reducing the validation window to 1 hour and increasing the token size to fifty random characters.\n\nThe vendor states that the issue has been patched in version **2.19.3** of the enterprise edition. The community edition will receive this patch in the annual upgrade, which will take place around November.",
