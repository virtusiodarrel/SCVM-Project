    "title": "Samba Vulnerable to Unauthorized Directory Creation via Race Condition in 'source3/smbd/open.c' File",
    "description": "A race condition vulnerability has been discovered in Samba. A privileged attacker could exploit this with a malicious client using an `SMB1` or `NFS` symlink race in order to create a directory in an area of the server file system not exported under the share definition.\n\n**Note**: In order for this attack to succeed, the attacker must have the permissions to create the directory in the target directory. `SMB1` must also be enabled, or the share also available via `NFS`.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `mkdir_internal()` function of the `source3/smbd/open.c` file. It was mitigated by restructuring the code in order to prevent a race condition from occurring.",

    "workaround": "The vendor has proposed the following workaround:\n\n> Do not enable `SMB1` (please note `SMB1` is disabled by default in Samba from version **4.11.0** and onwards). This prevents the creation of symbolic links via `SMB1`. If `SMB1` must be enabled for backwards compatibility then add the parameter:\n> \n> `unix extensions = no`\n> \n> to the `global` section of your `smb.conf` and restart `smbd`. This prevents `SMB1` clients from creating symlinks on the exported file system.\n> \n> However, if the same region of the file system is also exported using `NFS`, `NFS` clients can create symlinks that potentially can also hit the race condition. For non-patched versions of Samba we recommend only exporting areas of the file system by either `SMB2` or NFS, not both.",
