    "title": "XStream Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Deserialization of 'java.io.ByteArrayInputStream' Type",
    "description": "XStream, when in its default configuration or operating without a sufficient blacklist / whitelist configuration, is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) issue. This is due to how XStream can potentially create new instances of dangerous objects that are not blocked based on the contents of the input stream. The potentially dangerous type in this case is `java.io.ByteArrayInputStream`.\n\nAn attacker could supply a crafted input to XStream in order to cause an endless loop, negatively impacting the availability of XStream.",
    "technicalDescription": "XStream is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition when running without a sufficient blacklist / whitelist configuration because dangerous type information can be processed. At unmarshalling time, the processed stream contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. New instances are created based on the provided type information, meaning that potentially dangerous types that are not blocked can have new instances created.\n\nAn attacker could get XStream to unmarshal some XML (or another supported format like JSON) that contains a malicious `java.io.ByteArrayInputStream` type. `ByteArrayInputStream` (or a derived class) could be leveraged to cause an infinite loop when unmarshalling a buffer with a negative size and where the `count` and `mark` properties are both 0. Depending on the CPU type or parallel execution of the payload, it could be possible to allocate 100% of the CPU time on the target system.\n\n**Note**: The vendor has stated that XStream users who have set up the XStream security framework with a sufficient whitelist limited to the minimal required types are unaffected by this issue.",
