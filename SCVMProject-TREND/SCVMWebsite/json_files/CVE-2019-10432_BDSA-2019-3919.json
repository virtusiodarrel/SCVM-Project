    "description": "Jenkins HTML Publisher Plugin  is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input. A remote attacker could execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking them into visiting a web page that contains crafted content. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive data, such as browser cookies. The attacker would require the ability to manipulate a project's or a build's display name in order to accomplish this.",
    "technicalDescription": "Jenkins HTML Publisher Plugin includes the display name of a project and/or build within dynamically generated web pages. This is accomplished using code that is contained within `HtmlPublisherTarget.java`. This file contains two function, `getIconFileName()` and `getTitle()`, that retrieve the relevant display name by calling `project.getDisplayName()` or `build.getDisplayName()`. The values returned by these functions are not sanitized prior to their insertion within the dynamically generated web page. An attacker who has the ability to manipulate project's display name or a build's display name could therefore embed malicious scripts within the dynamically generated web pages. They could then cause these scripts to be executed within the browser of a victim by tricking that victim into visiting those web pages. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive data, such as browser cookies.",
