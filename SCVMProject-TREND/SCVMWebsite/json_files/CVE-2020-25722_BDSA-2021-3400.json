    "description": "Samba Active Directory (AD) Domain Controller (DC) does not perform per-attribute and schema based permission checks properly. This could lead to up to total domain compromise.",
    "technicalDescription": "Due to insufficient access and conformance checks, users who can set `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` can become any user in the domain on the server pointed at by this list. The lack of `sidHistory` protection causes a similar problem in a domain mixed with Microsoft Windows. Due to other flaws, this issue is not only limited to users with the right to create or modify users. \n\nFinally, Samba does not enforce `userPrincipalName` and `servicePrincipalName` uniqueness, nor does it correctly implement the `validated SPN` feature, allowing machine accounts to safely set their own SPN (the checks were easily bypassed and additionally should have been restricted to `objectClass=computer`).\n\nIn order to fix those issues, new behavioral changes were introduced to `userPrincipalName`, `servicePrincipalName` and `sAMAccountName` attributes on users and computers, particularly for non-administrators. The full description of the new changes is available [here](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2020-25722.html).",
