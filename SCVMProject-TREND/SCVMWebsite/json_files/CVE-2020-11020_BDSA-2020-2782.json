    "title": "Faye Vulnerable to Extension Access Control Policy Bypass via Extra Characters Added to Message Channel",
    "description": "Faye's extension system contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. It was found that any client could bypass checks put in place by server-side extensions by appending additional characters to the message channel.",
    "technicalDescription": "Faye's [extensions](https://faye.jcoglan.com/node/extensions.html) documentation suggests that the subscription access control should be implemented by checking messages sent to the `/meta/subscribe` channel and only performing authentication checks if the message's channel name matches `/meta/subscribe` exactly. The problem is that there is a bug in the server's code for recognizing special `/meta/*` channels (`/meta/handshake`, `/meta/connect`, `/meta/subscribe`, `/meta/unsubscribe`, `/meta/disconnect `) due to which malformed channel strings, such as `/meta/subscribe/x`, will be mistakenly accepted as subscription requests. Therefore, since the malformed string will does not exactly match `/meta/subscribe`, the extension's authentication logic will be bypassed but the subscription request accepted as valid by the server.\n\nThis flaw was fixed by implementing a strict equality check - only messages whose channel is exactly `/meta/subscribe` will be interpreted as subscription requests.",
