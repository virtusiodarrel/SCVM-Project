    "description": "VLC Media Player is vulnerable to information disclosure, and also denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. A local attacker could retrieve sensitive information from system memory by running the program with a crafted `.mkv` file as input. It should be noted that this vulnerability only affects the Windows version of VLC Media Player.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `vlc_entry_license__4_0_3()`, which is defined within the `libfaad_plugin.dll` library, is used to provide functionality to the Windows version of VLC Media Player. Whenever a `.mkv` file with a particular structure is being processed, flaws within the arithmetic performed by this library means that an integer value within `vlc_entry_license__4_0_3()` is decremented below the intended minimum value. This incorrect value will then be used to conduct additional memory manipulation operations, which will be detrimentally affected in such a way that the program will crash. An additional consequence of this integer underflow is that fragments of the application's memory can be revealed to the person running the program. A local attacker could therefore obtain potentially sensitive information by running the application with a crafted `.mkv` file that will trigger the underflow. An attacker could also cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the application with such a file as input.",
