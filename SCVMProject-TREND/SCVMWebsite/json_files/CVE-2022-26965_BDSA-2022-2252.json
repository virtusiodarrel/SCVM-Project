    "title": "Pluck Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Shell Upload in 'Theme Upload' Functionality",
    "description": "Pluck is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) issue due to how the 'theme upload' functionality does not sufficiently validate uploaded files.\n\nAn attacker with administrative privileges could abuse this functionality available at `/admin.php?action=themeinstall` to upload malicious files in order to gain access to the host and execute arbitrary code.\n\n**Note**: A project maintainer has closed a previous issue report and stated [here](https://github.com/pluck-cms/pluck/issues/104#issuecomment-904791269) that admin users should be able to upload any file.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because the file upload functionality present in the `data/inc/themeinstall.php` file does not validate uploaded files to ensure they are non-malicious themes when saving theme files.",
