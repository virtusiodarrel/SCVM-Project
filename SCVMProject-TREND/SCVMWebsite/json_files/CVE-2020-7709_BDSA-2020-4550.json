    "title": "Node.js 'json-pointer' Package Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution in 'set' Function",
    "description": "json-pointer is vulnerable to prototype pollution which allows an attacker to inject malicious properties into prototypes, which will then be inherited by all objects in that prototype chain. This can potentially  lead to denial-of-service (DoS) or code execution.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists in the `set()` function in the file `index.js` due to improper access to attributes of the prototype, such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker can access and modify these properties by referencing the object with slash notation.\n\n**Note**: A fix for **CVE-2020-7709** was made available in [**0.6.1**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-pointer/v/0.6.1) by [this](https://github.com/manuelstofer/json-pointer/commit/1dbd1ed6bef76f359dcf44d5b0e849d4881540b2) commit, however, it was later disclosed that a bypass exists for this fix in the form of **CVE-2021-23820** (**BDSA-2021-3436**). See **Workaround** for more information.",
