    "title": "zlib Vulnerable to Memory Corruption via Out-of-Bounds Write in Multiple Functions",
    "description": "zlib is vulnerable to memory corruption due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could potentially modify data in a vulnerable application's memory, or cause the application to crash, by causing it to process a maliciously crafted input file. It might also be possible for an attacker to leverage this vulnerability to recover sensitive data from memory.",
    "technicalDescription": "Problematic pointer arithmetic is implemented within multiple functions such that out-of-bounds access operations can occur whenever the `Z_FIXED` option is used. This is due to the corruption of the distance symbol table that can occur whenever data is written into the buffer which is used to store compressed data. An attacker could modify the memory of a vulnerable application by causing that application to process a maliciously crafted input file which specifies a large number of distant matches.",
