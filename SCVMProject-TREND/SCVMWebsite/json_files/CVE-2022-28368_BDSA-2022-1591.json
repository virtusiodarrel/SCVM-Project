    "title": "Dompdf Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via PHP File Inclusion in 'src:url' Field",
    "description": "Dompdf is vulnerable to a `.PHP`file inclusion flaw. A remote attacker that can upload specially crafted font files with Dompdf functionality could leverage this to execute remote code on the server.\n\n**Note** Versions after 0.8.5 need to have the configuration option `$isRemoteEnabled` set to true to be vulnerable.",
    "technicalDescription": "The flaw exists in the `registerFont()`function in `src/FontMetrics.php` due to improper file extension checks for uploaded/included font files, and insufficient validation of their content. An attacker that is able to upload specially crafted font files with a `.php` file extension, and where Dompdf files are remotely available from the web server root, can cause the execution of arbitrary PHP code.",

    "workaround": "The researchers provide the following advice [here](https://positive.security/blog/dompdf-rce):\n\n> 1. Make sure dompdf is not installed in a web-accessible directory. This is the most important point, as it would completely prevent the exploit\n> 2. Double-check the input sanitization you perform before passing data to dompdf, to prevent attackers from injecting HTML/CSS. This is a good idea in any case, as there might be other vulnerabilities that can be triggered in similar ways\n> 3. Update dompdf to a recent version and turn off $isRemoteEnabled, if possible for your use case. Though the most recent version available at time of publishing this article (1.2.0) is still susceptible to the vulnerability, it does consult the $isRemoteEnabled setting before attempting to download fonts from remote locations (unlike versions \u2264 0.8.5, which simply ignore the setting in that context)\n> 4. And finally, keep an eye out for a dompdf patch that fixes this vulnerability and apply it once it is available. You could for example stay up-to-date by subscribing to dompdf\u2019s release feed with an Atom reader of your choice",
