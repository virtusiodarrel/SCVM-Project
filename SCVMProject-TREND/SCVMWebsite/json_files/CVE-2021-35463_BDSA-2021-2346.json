    "title": "Liferay Portal Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insufficient Validation of  'keywords' Parameter",
    "description": "Liferay Portal is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient validation of client-provided input parameters. A remote attacker could execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking that victim into clicking on a maliciously crafted link. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The Frontend Taglib module within Liferay Portal provides a management toolbar that can make use of the `keywords` HTTP request parameter. The value of this parameter is used by the server to dynamically generate content within the toolbar that will be included in the response. The value is not sanitized or validated prior to its insertion into the dynamically generated content. If the value constitutes a XSS payload, then the payload will be executed by the client's browser whenever the content is rendered.\n\nA remote attacker could therefore carry out a reflected XSS attack by tricking a victim into clicking on a malicious link which contains a crafted `keywords` parameter.\n\nNote: The initial fix for this vulnerability was deemed to be completer and thus another CVE was created **CVE-2021-38264**(**BDSA-2022-0591**).",
