    "title": "Alkacon OpenCMS Vulnerable to CSV Formula Injection via Improper Input Validation in 'New User' Admin Function",
    "description": "An improper input validation vulnerability has been discovered in OpenCMS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a maliciously injected input, that when exported in specific file formats can lead to arbitrary code execution against the system.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in OpenCMS which can lead to arbitrary code execution against the host system. The account management section implements functionality to create new user accounts. The input fields `firstname` and `lastname` utilized by the form are not sanitized by the application. It is possible to inject arbitrary code starting with `=` to create a formula injection. If the user accounts are exported as a `.CSV` file and opened by specific programs such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc the injected input will be processed as a formula which can lead to malicious code being executed on the system.\n\nAn actor must have administrator level privileges to access the account management functionality.",
