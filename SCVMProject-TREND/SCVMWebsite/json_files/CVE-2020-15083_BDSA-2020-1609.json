    "title": "PrestaShop Vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Image Uploads",
    "description": "PrestaShop is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) due to lack of user-input validation during image file uploads. This could allow an attacker to include malicious JavaScript when creating a new images in the Product page. This could result in the attacker being able to steal authentication tokens, user cookies or other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of errors for user supplied images in the ` admin-dev/themes/default/js/bundle/product/form.js` file. \n\nIf an image errors on upload, data is appended to the error message as html. An attacker can exploit this by including malicious JavaScript when uploading an image file. The malicious script will be executed in the browser and the attacker will be able to steal authentication tokens, user cookies or other sensitive information.\n\nThe vendor has mitigated against this by appending data as text instead of html.",
