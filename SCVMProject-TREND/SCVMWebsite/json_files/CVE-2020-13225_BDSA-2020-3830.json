    "description": "phpIPAM is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue due to a lack of sufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the 'edit instructions' functionality.\n\nAn attacker with administrative privileges could insert a malicious script in order to steal a victim user's session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information.",
    "technicalDescription": "phpIPAM is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) because the 'edit instructions' functionality does not sufficiently restrict the use of malicious tags. \n\nAn attacker with administrative privileges could edit the HTML source in the 'edit instructions' functionality to include executable scripts and execute stored XSS attacks against users. The sanitization measures disallow script tags, however, they do not stop other script events from being used.",
