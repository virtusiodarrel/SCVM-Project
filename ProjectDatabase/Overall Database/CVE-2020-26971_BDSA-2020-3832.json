    "title": "Mozilla Client Applications Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in 'StretchedBlitNearest_PixelByPixel()' Function",
    "description": "Mozilla client applications including Firefox, Firefox-esr, and Thunderbird are vulnerable to remote code execution and denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of dynamically allocated memory resources. This allows a remote attacker to use crafted web content to cause an application crash, or potentially to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `StretchedBlitNearest_PixelByPixel()` is contained within the `libGLESv2` module. This function performs a `memcpy()` operation in order to copy data to the `destData` heap memory buffer. The location within this buffer to which the data should be copied is denoted by the `destPixel` pointer. \n\nThe value of this pointer is obtained by performing a calculation which uses variables with user-controlled values (`writeRow` and `writeColumn`). The values of these variables are obtained from the frame buffer which is contained within the web page that is being rendered. A crafted web page which creates a malicious frame buffer could be used to write data beyond the boundaries of the `destData` buffer. This could cause an exception to be raised, which will halt program execution and hence cause a DoS. It may also be possible to leverage this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution. An attacker must be able to trick a victim into loading a maliciously crafted web page in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
