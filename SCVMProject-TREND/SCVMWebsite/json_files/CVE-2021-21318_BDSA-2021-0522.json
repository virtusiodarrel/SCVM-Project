    "description": "Opencast is vulnerable to improper access control via `search service`. An attacker could exploit this in order to deny access to specific content for users that don't have super user privileges.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because if a attacker publishes an episode with strict access rules then this will override the currently set access rules for the entire series. This could be utilized to prevent access to an entire series by any non-superusers. There is also an issue with metadata persisting when a series is updated or removed which may affect the integrity of the search results. It was mitigated by ensuring that the `search service` will now merge access control lists for all episodes to ensure access is granted based on the combined access rules. Additionally,  this fix prevents the persistence of metadata upon deletion of an episode or series.",
