    "title": "Netty Vulnerable to Local Information Disclosure via Local System Temporary Directory",
    "description": "Netty contains a local information disclosure vulnerability on Unix-like systems due to a mishandling of temporary files as a result of an incomplete fix. An attacker with local user privileges could view sensitive information on temporary files as the temporary directory is shared between all users.\n\n**Note:** Per the Vendor this issue only impacts applications running Java 6 and lower.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `File.createTempFile()` function creates a random file with `-rw-r--r--` permissions, which would allow any local user to read the file's contents. An attempt to fix this was made by replacing the function with `Files.createTempFile()`, which uses safe-default on Java 7 onwards. However, the following logic path was left vulnerable, allowing for the file to still be readable:\n\n```\nif (directory == null) {\n            return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);\n        }\n```\n\nPermissions were also adjusted in all cases and default logging was added in the case of failure of adjusted permissions.\n\nThis issue exists due to an insufficient fix in **CVE-2021-21290**(**BDSA-2021-0311**).",
