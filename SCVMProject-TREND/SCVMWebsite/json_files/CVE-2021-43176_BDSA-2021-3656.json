    "title": "GOautodial Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Insufficient 'goAction' Parameter Validation",
    "description": "GOautodial is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the insufficient sanitization of a client-provided HTTP request parameter. An authenticated attacker can leverage this issue in order to execute arbitrary PHP files that are currently being stored on a vulnerable server.",
    "technicalDescription": "GOautodial's API router functionality is implemented using code which is contained in the file `goAPI.php`. If the `goAction` parameter is specified in HTTP requests that are processed by the API router, then the value of the parameter is extracted and assigned to the `$goAction` variable. The statement `include $goAction . \".php\"` is then executed in order to retrieve the contents of the PHP script that carries out the specified action. The value of `$goAction` is not sanitized prior to this. An attacker can therefore include a relative path in their request in order to retrieve and execute the contents of arbitrary PHP files that reside on the server. \n\nAuthenticated users can send messages with attachments within GOautodial. Attachments are stored at a predictable location on GOautodial servers. An authenticated attacker can leverage this in order to upload arbitrary PHP code onto a server. They can then use the aforementioned path traversal vulnerability to execute this code.",
