    "title": "Contiki-NG Vulnerable to Memory Corruption via Out-of-Bounds Write in .bss Section",
    "description": "Contiki-NG is vulnerable to memory corruption issues due to a lack of sufficient input validation when processing OIDs present in an SNMP request.\n\nThis flaw could allow an attacker to submit a crafted request in order to cause an out-of-bounds write to occur where the `varbinds` buffer is allocated in the `.bss` section. This could result in arbitrary overwrites of sensitive memory or cause instability.",
    "technicalDescription": "Contiki-NG is vulnerable to memory corruption because the number of OIDs present in an SNMP request is insufficiently validated. When a request is processed with a number of OIDs larger than that which is supported by the engine, out-of-bounds writes can occur.\n\nThe affected buffer in this case is `varbinds`, allocated in `.bss` in the `os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c` file. This buffer is written to in the `snmp_message_decode()` function in the `os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c` file without checking the buffer capacity.",
