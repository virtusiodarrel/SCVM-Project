    "description": "ChakraCore is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system, or could cause a victim's instance of ChakraCore to crash, by tricking them into opening a crafted web page or file.",
    "technicalDescription": "The ChakraCore scripting engine handles in-memory objects using a variety of scripts and functions. These include `GlobOpt::OptInstr()`, which is defined within the script `GlobOpt.cpp`, and `NativeCodeGenerator::CodeGen()`, which is defined within the script `NativeCodeGenerator.cpp`. These functions contain code that influence the dynamic generation of memory buffers during the JIT compilation process. The logic contained within these functions is flawed such that a discrepancy will exist between the allocated buffer size, and the quantity of data that will be written to that buffer. This will result in a buffer overflow. If data that is essential to the continuation of the program is overwritten, or the program attempts to write to disallowed memory addresses, the program's execution will be halted. An attacker could therefore execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system, or could cause a denial-of-service (DoS), by tricking a victim into opening a crafted web page or file which will cause the JIT compiler to incorrectly manage memory in the aforementioned manner.",
