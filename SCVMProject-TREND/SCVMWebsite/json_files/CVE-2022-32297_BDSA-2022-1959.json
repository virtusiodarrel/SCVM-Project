    "title": "Piwigo Vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLi) via 'Search' Function",
    "description": "Piwigo contains a second-order SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this issue by injecting specially crafted SQL statements through the search function. This would result in an injection of a malicious payload into the application, which could be used to gain access to a user's MySQL database and sensitive information such as passwords.",
    "technicalDescription": "The second-order nature of this SQL Injection (SQLi) allows for an attacker to inject malicious script which is later executed when interacted with by another user. In this case, a crafted URL is used and inserted via injection into the `piwigo_search` table, which when opened by another user or administrator would result in an ID containing their password to be inserted into the `piwigo_search` table. As this ID is incremental, an attacker could carry out a brute force attack to gain access to the account.",
