    "title": "cockpit Vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Login Page Functionality",
    "description": "cockpit is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) due to the improper validation of client-provided input parameters. A remote attacker could cause a vulnerable server to expose port information by sending requests to it.\n\nIt should be noted that this has been disputed by the vendor, who does not consider the issue to present a legitimate threat.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists within the `pkg/static/login.js` and `src/ws/cockpitauth.c` files. Unauthenticated attackers could exploit this by sending requests to internal hosts to locate open ports and potentially the protocol running on them.\n\nIt should be noted that this has been disputed by the vendor, who does not consider the issue to present a legitimate threat.",
