    "title": "Firefox Vulnerable to Authorization Bypass via Incomplete Content Security Policy Implementation",
    "description": "Firefox is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to the incomplete implementation of a security mechanism. A remote attacker could bypass security restrictions that are applied to certain files by including crafted formatting data within that file. This could give attackers a chance to attempt other kinds of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), by tricking a victim into downloading a file that contains crafted formatting data.",
    "technicalDescription": "An issue exists within Firefox within its implementation of its Content Security Policy functionality. This means that this functionality will not be applied to XSL stylesheets that are included with XML files. This means that an attacker can bypass Content Security Policy restrictions by using a maliciously crafted XSL stylesheet, potentially allowing them to attempt attacks such as XSS or data injection attacks.",
