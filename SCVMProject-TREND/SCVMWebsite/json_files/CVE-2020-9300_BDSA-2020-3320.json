    "description": "Netflix dispatch vulnerable to privilege escalation via access control issues. These issues can be exploited by an attacker in order to gain elevated privileges or access to `restricted` incidents.",
    "technicalDescription": "These issues occur due to improper access control implementations. For example a user who is registering for the service has the ability to allocate administrative privileges to themselves. Furthermore an authenticated user may have the ability to obtain general administrative access and a standard user may be able to gain access to `restricted` incidents that they should not have been able to. The issues were mitigated by filtering restricted incidents for non- administrator users, preventing standard users from joining such incidents, and no longer allowing a registering user to self-allocate administrator privileges. \n\nPer the vendor \"We expect that the typical Dispatch service is deployed internally, and configured to allow access from trusted users in an organization. If Dispatch is deployed in this way, the risk is lower, as the attacker would have to have access to a legitimate user account.\"",
