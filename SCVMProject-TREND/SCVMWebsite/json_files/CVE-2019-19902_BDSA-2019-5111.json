    "title": "Backdrop Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Improper Archive Validation",
    "description": "Backdrop content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the improper validation of files which have been provided in a configuration archive. A remote attacker, who has the `Synchronize, import, and export configuration` permission, could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server by uploading an archive which contains malicious scripts. A server-side scripting language which is not PHP must be available on the vulnerable server if the attack is to succeed.",
    "technicalDescription": "Backdrop CMS allows administrative users to upload configuration archives. The administrator must have the `Synchronize, import, and export configuration` permission in order to do this. The files that are associated with an uploaded archive are insufficiently validated, which could allow a remote attacker to upload malicious scripts in order to achieve remote code execution.\n\nA scripting language that is not PHP must be available on the vulnerable server in order for such an attack to succeed, as Backdrop CMS implements measures to prevent the execution of malicious PHP files.",
