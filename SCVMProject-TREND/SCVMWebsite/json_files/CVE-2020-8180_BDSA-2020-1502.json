    "title": "Nextcloud Talk Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Command Injection in Chat Commands",
    "description": "Nextcloud Talk is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker with administrator privileges could leverage this issue to execute arbitrary commands by sending a specially crafted chat command.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `execShell()` function in `lib/Chat/Command/ShellExecutor.php` does not properly validate the arguments from a chat command before they are sent to the `wrapExec()` function, and then executed as arguments in the call to the `@exec()` function. It is possible for an authenticated attacker to supply various commands and obtain responses to those commands depending on the Nextcloud Talk command used.\nFurthermore it is possible for an attacker to obtain a reverse shell by uploading a shell script through the Upload File functionality and accessing the file through this vulnerability.",
