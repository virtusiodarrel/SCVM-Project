    "title": "Ansible Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Insecure Directory Handling with 'become_user()' Function",
    "description": "Ansible is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to an incomplete fix for a race condition. A remote attacker could bypass the discretionary access control mechanisms imposed by other users by leveraging this race condition to gain control of a `become user`.\n\nNote that this issue exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1733 (BDSA-2020-0437).",
    "technicalDescription": "The inherent insecurity of the `mkdir -p` command means that a race condition is possible when the `become` directive is used on systems that utilize ACLs and FUSE filesystems. An attacker could potentially leverage this race condition in order to create a folder in `/var/tmp` that already exists. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on a directory that are under the discretionary control of that user.",
