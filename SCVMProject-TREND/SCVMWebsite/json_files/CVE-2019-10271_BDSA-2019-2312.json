    "description": "The Ultimate Member Plugin for Wordpress is vulnerable to the unauthorized modification of user accounts due to the insufficient implementation of security mechanisms. A remote authenticated attacker could change the  profile picture and cover picture of other low-privileged users. If the attacker possesses administrative credentials, then they could also change those of privileges users.",
    "technicalDescription": "The Ultimate Member Plugin for Wordpress allows users to modify their accounts in various ways. This includes uploading a profile picture and a cover picture. These features, as well as account login functionality, are implemented using functions such as `account_submit()` of `class-account.php` and `um_submit_account_details()` of `um-actions-account.php`. The application does not perform sufficient checks, however, to ensure that the account being modified actually belongs to the authenticated user who is making that modification. This could allow a remote authenticated attacker to change the profile picture and cover picture of other non-privileged users. An attacker with administrative privileges would also be able to conduct the aforementioned modifications on privileged user accounts.",
