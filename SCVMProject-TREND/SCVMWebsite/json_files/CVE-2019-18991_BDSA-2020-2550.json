    "title": "Qualcomm Wireless Chipsets Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via WPA2 Packet Injection",
    "description": "Multiple Qualcomm wireless chipsets are vulnerable to authentication bypass due to the insufficient validation of packets. An adjacent attacker could inject packets into a WPA2 network, and have them routed as though they were associated with a valid WPA2 session. A legitimate client must be connected to the network for the attack to be successful.\n\nIt should be noted that all of the chipsets that were identified as being vulnerable have reached end-of-life, and are discontinued. All currently supported Qualcomm chipsets are not vulnerable.",
    "technicalDescription": "The following chipsets and devices were tested and found to be vulnerable:\n\n> Chipset: AR9132\n> Devices tested: Zyxel NBG460N V3.60(AMX.8)\n\n> Chipset: AR9283\n> Devices tested: Buffalo WHR-G300N V2 V1.85 (R1.18/B1.03)\n\n> Chipset: AR9285\n> Devices tested: Netgear WNR1000 V.1.0.0.12NA\n\nIt should be noted that this list should not be considered as being comprehensive.",
