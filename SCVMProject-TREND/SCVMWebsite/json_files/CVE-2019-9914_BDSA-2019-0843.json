    "title": "YOP Poll Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'poll_id' Parameter",
    "description": "The YOP Poll WordPress plugin is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient validation of client-provided input. An attacker could execute arbitrary scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking them into clicking on a crafted link.",
    "technicalDescription": "The script `viewpollvotes.php` provides functionality that allows administrative users to view polling results. The user selects a particular poll by providing its unique ID, which is sent to the application via the `poll_id` request parameter. This ID is extracted from the request and embedded into the returned web page using the code `echo $poll->id`. No validation or sanitization is performed on the value of the `poll_id` request parameter. If it constitutes an XSS payload, this payload will be embedded within the response and executed by the clients browser. An attacker could therefore execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking them onto clicking a crafted URL in which the value of `poll_id` constitutes an XSS payload. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies. As the user in this case will have administrative credentials, this could allow the attacker to access the administrative interface of the application.",
