    "title": "Spring Cloud Function Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unsafe Expression Resource Access",
    "description": "Spring Cloud Function is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to the unsafe handling of Spring Expression Language (SPEL) expressions. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server that uses the package's routing functionality by sending an HTTP request that contains a maliciously crafted routing expression to that server.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).",
    "technicalDescription": "Spring Cloud Function's routing functionality is implemented using the `RoutingFunction` class, which is defined in the file`spring-cloud-function-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/function/context/config/RoutingFunction.java`. This class contains the `route()` method, which contains code that can dynamically create functions by extracting expressions that are specified within HTTP headers. This is done by performed by invoking the `functionFromExpression()` method, which is also contained within the `RoutingFunction` class. Insufficient protections are implemented for this functionality. An attacker could craft a HTTP header that specifies a malicious payload within a SPEL expression, and then send that header to a vulnerable endpoint via an HTTP request. The payload will be executed whenever a function is generated from the expression and then subsequently called.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed via the inclusion of additional validation based on whether or not an expression was received via a HTTP request header.",
