    "title": "BigBlueButton Vulnerable to Poll Vote Tampering via Vote Count Restriction Flaw",
    "description": "BigBlueButton is vulnerable to a poll vote tampering issue due to how users can vote multiple times in a poll, impacting poll results.\n\nAuthenticated users could abuse this flaw to negatively impact the integrity of poll results.",
    "technicalDescription": "BigBlueButton is vulnerable to poll vote tampering because the poll functionality does not sufficiently validate if a user has already cast a vote in a poll. Since the voting ability is not removed from a user once they have cast their vote, they can cast more than one vote, impacting the integrity of the poll results.",
