    "title": "WolfSSL Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Timing Side Channel in ECDSA Signature Generation",
    "description": "WolfSSL is vulnerable to information disclosure due to a timing-based cryptographic weakness. An attacker could obtain the private key that is being used during an SSL session by using statistical analysis techniques. It should be noted that the information leakage that corresponds to this vulnerability is minuscule and thus would be extremely difficult to exploit in the real world.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `wc_ecc_mulmod_ex()`, which is defined within `ecc.c`, is used during the generation of ECDH and ECDSA keys. The key generation process involves the multiplication of scalar values. The duration of the scalar multiplication process can be used to infer information about the values of certain bits within a scalar value that is being used. An attacker who is able to measure the duration of a large number of these multiplication operations would potentially be able to infer the value of the secret key that is negotiated. \n\nIt should be noted that the information leakage that corresponds to this vulnerability is very small, and thus would be difficult to exploit in the real world.",
