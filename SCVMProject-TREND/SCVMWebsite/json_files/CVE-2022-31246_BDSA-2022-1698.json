    "title": "Electrum Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Arbitrary File Read in 'file' Functionality",
    "description": "Electrum contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this issue by providing a maliciously crafted QR code or text to a victim, which when opened would open a URI file in read mode. This could lead to an application crash on linux/macOS-based systems and potential capture of authentication tokens in Windows systems.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue exists due to Electrum opening and reading `file://` URIs passed as part of the payment flow process, through a QR or text to a user. The `?r=` field can contain an arbitrary `file` URI, which can be selected by an attacker. A successful read would lead to the parsing of the file and may result in exploitation. \n\nMitigation for this issue came in the form of removing support for the `file` URIs.",
