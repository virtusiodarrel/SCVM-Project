    "description": "FUEL content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) due to the insufficient validation of client requests. An attacker could cause a victim to inadvertently delete pages by tricking them into interacting with maliciously crafted web content.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `delete()` function, of file `Module.php`, is used by the `/pages/delete` endpoint in order to delete pages within FUEL CMS. This function performs insufficient validation on the data that is retrieved from deletion requests. A remote attacker could cause a user to inadvertently delete pages by tricking them into interacting with maliciously crafted web content. This web content will send a forged request to a vulnerable endpoint.",
