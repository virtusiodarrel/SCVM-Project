    "title": "Jakarta Expression Language Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Bug in 'ELParserTokenManager'",
    "description": "Jakarta Expression Language is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to a bug that enables invalid expressions to be evaluated as if they were valid. Applications that evaluate user-supplied expressions in error messages are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.",
    "technicalDescription": "The vulnerability is caused by a bug in the parser [grammar](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/el-ri/blob/ab8e8c05348fb4f848b8d9b8679d16eb16c6f093/impl/src/main/java/com/sun/el/parser/ELParser.jjt#L451) which is used by the `ELParserTokenManager` class. The parser improperly sanitizes deferred expressions (`#{expr}`) that are used in Bean Validation constraint error messages. Normally, a `$` or `#` character followed by a character that is not `{`, `$` or `#` will be sanitized (treated as a literal expression). However, if the character that follows `$` or `#` is a backslash, then the parser will treat the backslash as being part of the literal expression and will leave the character that follows it unescaped. This means that expressions such as `FOO $\\#{payload}` will bypass the application's sanitization mechanism and will be evaluated successfully.",
