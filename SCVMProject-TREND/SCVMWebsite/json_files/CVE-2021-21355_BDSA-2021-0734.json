    "title": "TYPO3 Vulnerable to Unrestricted File Upload via 'Form' Framework",
    "description": "TYPO3 is vulnerable to unrestricted file upload via `Form` framework. As uploaded files are stored in a default location `/fileadmin/user_upload/` an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to directly reference files that are currently stored in the default location.",
    "technicalDescription": "Owing to a lack of file extension restrictions attackers can upload files with arbitrary extensions. This does not include  `.htaccess` or `malicious.php` files as these are blocked by default by `fileDenyPattern`.\n\n`Extbase` extensions, which utilize file uploads but do not implement a custom `TypeConverter` to transform uploaded files into `FileReference` domain model objects are also affected by the vulnerability. This is because the `UploadedFileReferenceConverter` function of `ext:form` handles file uploads and it will accept files of any mime-type currently existing in the default location.\n\n**Note:** The `UploadedFileReferenceConverter` type converter is not registered globally anymore and it only handles uploaded files within the scope of the `form` framework. Additionally the guessable storage location has changed from `/fileadmin/user_upload/form_<random-hash>/` to `/fileadmin/form_uploads/`. Allowed mime-types must also now match expected file extensions, for example `.pdf` must be a `.pdf` file and not `.html`.\n\n`Extbase` extensions that rely on the global availability of the `UploadedFileReferenceConverter` must now utilize a custom `TypeConverter` to handle file uploads or, instead, explicitly implement the `ext:form` `UploadedFileReferenceConverter` with appropriate settings for accepted mime-types.",
