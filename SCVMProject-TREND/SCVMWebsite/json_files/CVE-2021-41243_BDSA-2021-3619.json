    "description": "baserCMS is vulnerable to Zip Slip attacks and OS command injection due to the unsafe handling of zip files. An attacker with file upload permissions could exploit this via a crafted zip file in order to execute arbitrary OS commands.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in a number of files which relate to the handling of zip files. It was mitigated by switching to using `Zip Archive` instead of `Simple Zip`, by improving error logging, and by the addition of input content verification during the execution of fixed page previews.",
