    "title": "Zlib Decrement of a Pointer Before Its Allocated Memory Results in Undefined Behaviour",
    "description": "Zlib violates the C standard by decrementing a pointer before its allocated memory. This could result in undefined behavior leading to a denial-of-service condition. To exploit, an attacker could trick a user into opening a specially crafted file with the component.",
    "technicalDescription": "The C standard dictates that it is forbidden  to decrement a pointer before its allocated memory.  An [automated security assessment](https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/0/09/Zlib-report.pdf) of Zlib performed by Trail of Bytes found code within the component which violates this dictum, specifically in `crc32.c`.  The code in question was removed as of **1.2.9** to prevent the possibility of undefined behavior arising from it.\n\nResearch has shown that in past instances vulnerabilities such as this have eventually been exploited by attackers to gain remote code execution or privilege escalation. Development of such an exploit is often a lengthy process, and these exploits are often highly prized. While there is currently no evidence to suggest that a remote code execution exploit exists for this particular vulnerability, we cannot guarantee that one will not be developed in the future.\n\nVulnerability was introduced by [this](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/7c2a874e50b871d04fbd19501f7b42cff55e5abc) commit.",
