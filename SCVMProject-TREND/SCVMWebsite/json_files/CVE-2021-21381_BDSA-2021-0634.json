    "title": "Flatpak Vulnerable to Sandbox Escape via Special Tokens in '.desktop' File Allowing Arbitrary File Read/Write Operations",
    "description": "Flatpak is vulnerable to incorrectly handling special escape tokens in `.desktop` files. A remote attacker able to compromise a app or able trick a victim into downloading and executing a malicious app, could gain access to files that would not ordinarily be allowed by the app's permissions.",
    "technicalDescription": "It is possible for an attacker to place special tokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the Exec field of a Flatpak app's .desktop file. This can trick Flatpak into behaving as though the user had chosen to open a target file with their Flatpak app. This makes the specified file(s) available to the Flatpak app and constitutes an escape of the sandbox environment.\n\nThe issue was resolved by disallowing `@@` and `@@u` magic tokens in desktop files.",
