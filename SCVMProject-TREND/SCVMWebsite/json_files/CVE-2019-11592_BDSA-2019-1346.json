    "title": "WeBid Vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'id' GET Request Parameter",
    "description": "WeBid is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting due to the insufficient validation of client-provided input. A remote attacker could execute malicious scripts within the web browser of a victim by tricking them into clicking a crafted link. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `id` and `offset` GET request parameters are accessed by a variety of scripts within WeBid, including `deletenews.php`, `editbannersuser.php` and `excludeuser.php`. The value that is associated with these parameters is used to dynamically construct content on the web page that will be returned to the user. The value is not sanitized, and so if it contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload, this will be delivered to the client's browser and executed. An attacker could therefore execute malicious scripts within the web browser of a victim by tricking them into clicking a crafted link. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies. This vulnerability exists in a number of scripts associated with the administrative interface, potentially allowing the attacker to gain administrative access to the application. \n\nA variety of `POST` request parameters are similarly affected; these parameters include `TPL_name`, `TPL_address` and `TPL_prov`. Such parameters are used in the scripts `register.php` and `user_login.php`. An attacker must trick a victim into interacting with a crafted malicious web page in order to carry out the XSS exploit using these parameters.",
