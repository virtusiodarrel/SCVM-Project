    "title": "Netty Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling via Missing 'Content-Length' Validation with 'endStream' Flag",
    "description": "Netty is vulnerable to an HTTP request smuggling issue due to how the `Content-Length` header is not correctly validated.\n\nAn attacker could send crafted requests containing additional, smuggled requests in order to access other internal resources.",
    "technicalDescription": "Netty is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling because the `Content-Length` header is not correctly validated if the request only uses a single `Http2HeaderFrame` with the `endStream` flag set to `TRUE`.\n\nAn attacker could craft a request abusing the `endStream` flag flaw in order to perform request smuggling attacks. These attacks can succeed if the request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to `HTTP/1.1`.\n\n**Note**: The Netty HTTP request smuggling vulnerability was originally reported as **CVE-2021-21295**. The fix however, was incomplete and did not consider requests using a single `Http2HeaderFrame`.",
