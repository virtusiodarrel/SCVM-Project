    "title": "Redis Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Heap Buffer Overflow Caused by Large Bulk Input",
    "description": "Redis is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to a heap buffer overflow that can be caused by a large bulk input triggering integer overflows. A malicious client could send a large request and cause Redis to crash. The vendor also does not rule out the possibility of remote code execution (RCE) in certain scenarios.\n\nThe vulnerability only affects 32-bit Redis instances that use a much larger than default (512MB) limit for the maximum supported bulk input size.",
    "technicalDescription": "The default maximum supported bulk input size (512MB) is a safe value for all platforms. However, an authenticated Redis user could make the system vulnerable by increasing the limit via the `CONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len` command.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by setting a reasonable limit to the `proto-max-bulk-len` parameter and adding `assert` checks to prevent the problem in other potential but unknown code paths.",
