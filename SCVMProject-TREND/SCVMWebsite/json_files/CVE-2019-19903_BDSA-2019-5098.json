    "title": "Backdrop Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via 'theme_file_type_overview()' Function",
    "description": "Backdrop content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the improper sanitization of client-provided input. A remote attacker could execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking that victim into viewing a maliciously crafted file description. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `theme_file_type_overview()`, of file `file.theme.inc`, dynamically produces HTML content which displays file type descriptions. It does this by inserting the value of the `$variables['description']` variable into a `div` element. No sanitization or validation is performed on this value prior to insertion. An authenticated attacker who can create or modify file type descriptions could specify a description that constitutes a XSS payload. This payload will be executed in the browser of a victim who views this description. This could potentially allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.\n\nThe attacker must have the \"Administer file types\" permission assigned to their account in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
