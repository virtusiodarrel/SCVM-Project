    "description": "Craft content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue due to how .htm and .html files can be uploaded by default.\n\nFront-end forms that accept user uploads, such as in plugins like `Guest Entries`, could allow attackers the ability to upload a crafted file containing malicious scripts. These scripts could execute in the context of a victim user's browser if they are tricked into viewing the tainted content.\n\n**Note**: In a third-party [advisory](https://hackberry.xyz/from-burnout-to-rce-getting-out-of-the-rat-race#poc-or-gtfo), the issue reporter indicates that this issue could be chained with **CVE-2021-27903** (**BDSA-2021-1984**) in order to achieve remote code execution (RCE) after tricking an administrative user into viewing the tainted content.",
    "technicalDescription": "Craft CMS is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) because the `allowedFileExtensions` configuration setting found in the `src/config/GeneralConfig.php` file allows for .htm and .html files to be uploaded by default. Files of this type could be crafted to include malicious scripts.",
