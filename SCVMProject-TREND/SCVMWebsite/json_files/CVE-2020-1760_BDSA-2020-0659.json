    "title": "Ceph Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Header Splitting in 'GetObject' API",
    "description": "Ceph is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the improper handling of client-provided input. A remote attacker could execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking them into clicking on a maliciously crafted URI. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `GetObject` API is used to retrieve objects from S3 server clusters. The headers in the response that the client receives can be dynamically generated using a variety of query parameters, such as `response-content-type` and `response-content-encoding`. An attacker can craft malicious values for these queries that will cause the response headers to become split, with a malicious cross-site scripting (XSS) payload being injected into the body of the response. A remote attacker could therefore execute malicious scripts within the browser of a victim by tricking them into clicking on a maliciously crafted URI. In order to achieve this, the attacker must know the path to a publicly readable object on a RGW cluster, and that object must be at least large enough to cover the attack body.",
