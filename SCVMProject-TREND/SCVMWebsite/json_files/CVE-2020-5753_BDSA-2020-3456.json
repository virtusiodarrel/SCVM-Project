    "title": "Signal for Android and iOS Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via DNS Server Leakage",
    "description": "Signal for Android, and iOs, is vulnerable to information disclosure due to issues in the processing of ICE candidates. A remote attacker could discover which DNS server a victim is using via a malicious call to that victim's phone. This would reveal coarse information about the victim's location. If the DNS server is using an EDNS Client Subnet, they will also be able to obtain a fragment of the victim's IP address. \n\nThe attacker must own an authoritative nameserver in order for the attack to succeed.",
    "technicalDescription": "Signal implements WebRTC for the processing of ICE candidate information. The domain name support that is implemented by ICE candidates means that an attacker can provide a domain name to a callee which will then be resolved. If the attacker owns the name server which is authoritative for that domain, then they will be aware of the DNS user that the callee is using. This could potentially reveal coarse information about the callee's location. If the DNS request is resolved in a manner that implements the EDNS Client Subnet extension, then a fragment of the victim's IP address will also be revealed.",
