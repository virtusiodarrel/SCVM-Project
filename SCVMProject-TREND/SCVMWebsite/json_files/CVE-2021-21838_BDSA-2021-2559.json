    "description": "GPAC is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) and denial-of-service (DoS) due to the improper management of system memory resources. An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on a victim's machine by tricking that victim into running the application with a maliciously crafted input file. It is also possible for an attacker to cause the application to crash.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `fpar_box_read()`, of file `src/isomedia/box_code_base.c`, defines the local variable `ptr`. This is a pointer to a `FilePartitionBox` structure. The `ptr->entries` member is a pointer to an array of `FilePartitionEntry` structures. The number of `FilePartitionEntry` structures which exist in the array is denoted by the value of the `ptr->nb_entries` member. The data type of `nb_entries` is `u32`, and its value is obtained via a call to `gf_bs_read_int()`. \nThis value is validated by comparing it to the value of the `ptr->size` member. However, `ptr->size` is of type `u64`. This can cause the function to fail to detect if `ptr->nb_entries` is too large.\n\nThe array that is associated with `ptr->entries` is implemented as a buffer on the heap. This buffer is allocated by invoking the `GF_SAFE_ALLOC_N()` macro. This macro calculates the amount of memory that needs to be allocated, and then calls `gf_malloc()` in order to actually perform the allocation.  The macro determines the amount of memory that needs to be allocated via the calculation `ptr->nb_entries * sizeof(FilePartitionEntry)`. If `nb_entries` is too large, than an integer overflow can occur. This means that the value that is passed to `gf_malloc()` will be too small. As a consequence of this, the heap buffer that is allocated will not be large enough to hold the data which is extracted from the bit stream `bs`.\n\nA heap buffer overflow will therefore occur whenever the `for` loop which populates the `ptr->entries` buffer is evaluated. This can cause an exception to be raised, halting program execution. An attacker who is able to trick a victim into running the program with a maliciously crafted input file could leverage this in order to cause a DoS. It may also be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code, although this has not been demonstrated.",
