    "description": "October content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary web script in the context of a users browser, leading to sensitive data loss such as session cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue is part of the post creation features of October CMS. If an attacker has the permissions required to manage blog posts, they are able to add arbitrary JavaScript to a blogpost. When this is rendered on the site, and user visiting the site (including an admin) will have arbitrary code executed in the context of their browser.\n\nThis issue was fixed by adding a new permission that needs to be granted in order for a user to store JavaScript in markdown called `backend.allow_unsafe_markdown`.",
