    "title": "Pluck Content Management System (CMS) Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Admin File Upload",
    "description": "Pluck content management system (CMS) is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via admin file upload functionality. An attacker with administrator permissions could upload a file that would execute arbitrary host OS commands once it is accessed directly via browser.",
    "technicalDescription": "When uploading files through `manage files` functionality, Pluck CMS normally adds `.txt` endings to `.php` files to prevent them from being executed once they are accessed. However, it was found that Pluck does not neutralize a `.php` file if it is uploaded twice. The vendor has acknowledged that this vulnerability appears for Pluck instances that use PHP versions **5.x**. Since PHP 5 is [no longer supported](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php), Pluck was updated to require PHP **7** and higher. This fixes the vulnerability.",
