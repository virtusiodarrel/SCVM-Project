    "title": "FreeRADIUS Vulnerable to Reflection Attacks via Improper Authentication in 'EAP-PWD' COMMIT Frame Validation",
    "description": "An improper authentication vulnerability has been discovered in FreeRADIUS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute reflection attacks against the target network.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in FreeRADIUS which can be manipulated by reflection style attacks to bypass authentication validation. The WPA3 protocol implemented by the application utilizes a key agreement method called authentication of equals (SAE) which is a variant of the Dragonfly Key Exchange.\n\nIt was discovered this method could be manipulated by an attacker, to expose the server commit scalar and elliptic curve element values as well as the confirm value. This allows a malicious actor to forge their own peer commit frame to trick the authentication process and gain access to the network. The negotiated session key will not be valid during this manipulated session, which means the actor can only perform limited actions.\n\nThe peer commit frame scalar and elliptic curve elements were not validated against the correct range limit. This was caused by the `process_peer_commit` function located in the file `src/modules/rlm_eap/types/rlm_eap_pwd/eap_pwd.c` utilizing an incorrect variable name which weakness cascaded to other functions.",
