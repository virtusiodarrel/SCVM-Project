    "title": "Spring Framework Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via 'ClassLoader' Access Control Bypass with Java9 'getModule()' Method",
    "description": "Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).",
    "technicalDescription": "The intended access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property were implemented as a denylist to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622). This approach was fragile and vulnerable to Java API changes introducing alternative paths to access this property. One such alternative path was introduced with the Java9 platform. The `getModule()` method could be leveraged to return the `ClassLoader` and re-enabled exploitation opportunities.\n\nThe issue was resolved by implementing tighter restrictions to the `ClassLoader` property in `spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/CachedIntrospectionResults.java`.",
