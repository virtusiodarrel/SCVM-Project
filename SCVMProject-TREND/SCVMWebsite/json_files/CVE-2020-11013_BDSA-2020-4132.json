    "title": "Helm Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via 'lookup()' Template Function",
    "description": "Helm is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the insufficient enforcement of restrictions on a data retrieval function. A remote attacker could recover information relating to a cluster by injecting a malicious `lookup` into a chart.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `lookup()` function that is implemented by Helm does not enforce the policy that the `helm template` command should not attach to remote clusters. A remote attacker that is able to create charts could inject a `lookup()` call into a chart that will connect to, and perform lookups against, a victim's cluster (as pointed to by the victim's `KUBECONFIG` file). In this way, the attacker could retrieve information from the cluster that is potentially sensitive.\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by adding code to the `renderResources()` function, of file `pkg/action/action.go`, which enforces the aforementioned policy whenever the `helm template` command is executed.",
