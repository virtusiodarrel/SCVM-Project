    "title": "gatsby-source-wordpress Plugin Vulnerable to Exposure of HTTP Basic Authentication Credentials during Build Time",
    "description": "gatsby-source-wordpress plugin for Gatsby improperly protects credentials. HTTP Basic Authentication credentials are leaked into the `app.js` bundle during build time exposing them to unauthorized actors. An attacker could locate these credentials, include them in a HTTP header request to bypass authentication and exploit the Gatsby framework.\n\n**Note:** If you are not initializing Basic Authentication credentials within the file `gatsby-config.js`, you are not affected by this.",
    "technicalDescription": "HTTP Basic Authentication credentials are leaked into `gatsby-config.js` during build time and are obtainable post-build. This was addressed by filtering all variables, `username` and `password`, outlined in the `auth` section of `gatsby-config.js`. Also by ensuring that the `auth` section is removed from `pluginOptions`, preventing its contents being available within the browser.",
