    "description": "libssh2 is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them connecting to a malicious server.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `_libssh2_transport_read`, defined within `transport.c`, collects a received packet into the input queue. Data relating to the packet's characteristics is stored within the structure `p`. The `packet_length` component of this structure is used to dynamically allocate memory for the packet's data following an arithmetic operation. No validation is performed on the value of `packet_length`, such that an integer overflow can occur when this arithmetic operation takes place. This can lead to the creation of a buffer that is too small to hold the packet's data, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This buffer overflow could potentially overwrite data that is essential for the continuation of the program, causing a crash. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by supplying a crafted data packet in which `packet_length` is large enough to cause the integer overflow to occur.",
