    "title": "Jenkins Vulnerable to Information Disclosure via TCP Agent Encryption Key Parameter Reuse",
    "description": "Jenkins is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the improper implementation of encryption. An unauthenticated remote attacker could obtain the Jenkins connection secret that is being used by a victim's Jenkins master instance, and then use that secret to connect malicious Jenkins agents to that instance. It should be noted that the problematic protocol must be explicitly enabled within Jenkins.",
    "technicalDescription": "Jenkins implements the Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 in order to facilitate connections between a Jenkins master instance and its agents. These connections involve the sharing of a secret, which is shared over a cryptographically secured channel. The cryptographic operations that are conducted by the protocol are reused such that a remote unauthenticated attacker can derive the secret, and can therefore connect to the Jenkins master instance.  It should be noted that the problematic protocol must be explicitly enabled within Jenkins.",
