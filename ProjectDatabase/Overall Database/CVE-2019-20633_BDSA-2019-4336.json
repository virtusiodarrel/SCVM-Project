    "title": "GNU Patch Vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Double Free in 'another_hunk()' Function",
    "description": "GNU Patch is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the application with a maliciously crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The function `another_hunk()`, which is defined within the file `pch.c`, makes use of the variable `p_line`, which is an array of pointers. The variable `p_end` is used as an index into this pointer. Under certain conditions, the function will execute `free(p_line[p_end])` with the same value of `p_end` more than once. This constitutes a double free, which can lead to an exception being raised. This will halt program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a DoS by tricking a victim into running the application with a maliciously crafted file, which will trigger the aforementioned event.",
