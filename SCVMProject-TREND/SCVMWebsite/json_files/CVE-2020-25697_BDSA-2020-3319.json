    "title": "X Server Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Missing Client Side Server Authentication",
    "description": "The X11 windowing system is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to missing server verification on the client side. In certain scenarios it is possible to take over the client application by impersonating the server it expects to be connected to.",
    "technicalDescription": "The exploitation of this vulnerability is not trivial since it is necessary to to wait until the legitimate X server exits and its socket is unlinked. Therefore the vulnerability may only appear if an X client application erroneously starts running after the X server has quit. This can happen in the following scenarios:\n* The application is started outside the graphical session and it sets the `DISPLAY` environment variable to `:0`. This may happen if the application only expects one X server to be running at a time.\n* There is a race condition during the exit of the X server - if an X application is run by another program at the time the X server unlinks its associated socket, an attacker may bind to the socket before the client tries to connect to it.\n\nThe maintainers of X11 have stated that implementing server authentication would require major changes to the X protocol and that exploitation via the scenarios above is possible, but unlikely.",
