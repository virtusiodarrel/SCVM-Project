    "title": "Unbound Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution Due to Insufficient Filtering via 'ipsecmod/ipsecmod.c'",
    "description": "Unbound contains a remote code execution vulnerability. Lack of filtering allows an attacker to supply a specially crafted IPSECKEY answer containing shell code. If successful and certain conditions are met, upon receiving the answer Unbound will execute the code on the vulnerable system.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability is located in `ipsecmod/ipsecmod.c`. When Unbound is compiled and enabled with ipsecmod support, it is possible for an attacker to pass shell code via a specially crafted IPSECKEY answer via the `ipsecmod-hook` shell command.\n\nThis vulnerability can only be exploited when the following conditions are met:\n\n1. Unbound is compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod` support.\n2. Ipsecmod is enabled and configured for use via a config file or `unbound-control`.\n3. A domain is part of the `ipsecmod-whitelist`. \n4. Unbound contains an A/AAAA query for a domain that has an A/AAAA record and IPSECKEY available.\n\nIf the `qname` or `gateway` field of an IPSECKEY configured with gateway type 3 contains a specially crafted domain name, shell code execution will occur.\n\n`ipsecmod/ipsecmod.c` was introduced by [this](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/commit/491b0a26e45aabb236d407f5892f296f44b462fe) commit.",
