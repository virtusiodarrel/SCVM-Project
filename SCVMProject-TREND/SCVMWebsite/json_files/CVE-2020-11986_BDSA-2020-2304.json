    "title": "Apache NetBeans Vulnerable to Malicious Script Execution via Immediate Foreign Script Execution",
    "description": "Apache NetBeans is vulnerable to malicious script execution due to immediate execution of foreign scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a victim with crafted content.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs because to be able to analyze a Gradle project, the build script has to be executed. This pattern is followed by Netbeans. This does not allow the user to prevent or intercept the execution of the file once it has started. This was mitigated by the introduction of a trust relationship with Gradle projects. This is intended to prevent unintentional Gradle invocation.",
