    "title": "Cloud Foundry UAA Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Client Scope Restriction Bypass",
    "description": "Cloud Foundry UAA is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to improper enforcement of client scope restrictions. This could allow an attacker in control of a malicious client to create clients with arbitrary scopes of privilege, in order to fully compromise the UAA server.",
    "technicalDescription": "UAA does not properly enforce restrictions on clients created using the `clients.write` authority or scope. `clients.write` should only allow scopes that are prefixed with the creating client ID, but it also incorrectly allows scopes prefixed with the ***created*** client ID, which is controlled by the user creating the new client. \n\nAn attacker in control of a client which possesses the `clients.write` authority/scope can exploit this to create a client whose ID is a prefix of an existing scope. For example, if the attacker creates a client with ID `cloud_controller`, they are then able to assign the `cloud_controller.admin` scope to the client (which in turn can be assigned back to the attacker's original client).\n\nScopes must be authorized by a user with matching group memberships before they can be used. However, UAA allows scopes to be set as auto-approved - this can be abused by an attacker to trick a privileged victim into approving a more restrictive scope, which also auto-approves the `cloud_controller.admin` scope without their awareness. In doing so, the attacker can gain full administrative control over the UAA server.",
