    "title": "httplib2 Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling via CRLF Injection in 'request()' Function",
    "description": "httplib2 is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling due to the improper parsing of client requests. A remote attacker could send multiple hidden requests to a server by including certain characters in the body of a request.",
    "technicalDescription": "The `request()` method, which belongs to the `Http` class within httplib2, is used to parse the HTTP requests that have been received from clients. This function does not sanitize or detect for the presence of `CRLF` characters within the client request. If those characters have not been sanitized by another component, the request will be split on those characters. This could allow a remote attacker to send multiple hidden requests to a server.",
