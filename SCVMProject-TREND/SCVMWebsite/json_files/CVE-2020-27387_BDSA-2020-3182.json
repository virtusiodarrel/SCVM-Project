    "title": "HorizontCMS Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unrestricted File Upload",
    "description": "HorizontCMS is vulnerable to remote code execution due (RCE) to insufficient restrictions on the upload of dangerous files. An authenticated remote attacker with access to the `FileManager` could exploit this flaw by uploading malicious files which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue relates to the `fileupload` and the `rename`functions in the  `app/Controllers/FileManagerController.php` file. A remote attacker with access to the `FileManager` could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a PHP payload with an alternative extension. Once uploaded the file can be renamed with a .php extension before being executed via an HTTP `GET` request to `/storage/<php_file_name>`.\nIt was mitigated by the addition of a `validationRegex` function.",
