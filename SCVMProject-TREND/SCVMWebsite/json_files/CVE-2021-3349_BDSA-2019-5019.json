    "title": "GNOME Evolution Vulnerable to Email Signature Spoofing",
    "description": "GNOME Evolution is vulnerable to a signature spoofing issue due to how email signatures can be reported as trusted when using a forged UID.\n\nThis issue could lead to Evolution users trusting malicious or phished emails and treating them as legitimate.",
    "technicalDescription": "GNOME Evolution is vulnerable to signature spoofing because the trust of one OpenPGP key UID is extrapolated to the key itself within the Evolution user interface. This trust is reported to users alongside potentially untrusted UIDs in the signature status bar.\n\nFor an attacker to exploit this issue, the attacker's key is required to gain recipient's trust, e.g. via OpenPGP WoT model. This may require the attacker to disclose their identity or trick additional people into accepting a forged identity. The mismatched identity is also apparent upon key inspection.\n\n**Notes**: \n* The vendor closed the issue report stating [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution/-/issues/299#note_421369) that they believe changes are required in GnuPG component.\n* The issue was reported to GnuPG [here](https://dev.gnupg.org/T4735), where changes have been made to the `--sender` option and released in version GnuPG **Beta-2.3.0-beta1598**.\n* The issue reporter has argued [here](https://mgorny.pl/articles/evolution-uid-trust-extrapolation.html) that the existing GnuPG API should be sufficient to resolve the problem. They believe that Evolution could use `--list-keys --with-colons` to easily determine validity of each UID corresponding to the key.",
