    "title": "Bolt Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Uploaded File Renaming Functionality",
    "description": "Bolt is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.  An attacker could take advantage of this to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of a user of the affected site. The victim must click on a malicious link to activate the payload.",
    "technicalDescription": "Bolt is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) because files that have been created or uploaded previously can be renamed by users and the new name is not sanitized correctly. This means scripts could be stored in the name field.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to rename a file on the content management system (CMS) to include potentially malicious scripts. The script is stored and a victim can trigger the script by viewing the file which can execute in the context of the victim's browser.",
