    "title": "389-ds-base Vulnerable to Information Disclosure During the Binding of a DN",
    "description": "389-ds-base is vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw. A remote unauthenticated attacker can use discrepancies in responses to determine the existence of an entry in the lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) database. **Note** there is some dispute over this being an actual vulnerability, as timing attacks could be also leveraged to achieve the same result, and the information gained is small.",
    "technicalDescription": "As the reply from 389-ds-base will be different whether the DN exists or not when binding against a DN during authentication. An attacker could leverage this to check for the existence of an entry in the LDAP database. The issue was resolved by not returning any additional information during a bind.",
