    "title": "Directus Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbitrary File Upload",
    "description": "Directus is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via arbitrary file upload. A low-privileged user can upload malicious PHP files to the server and execute arbitrary code. \n\nThis issue only applies to version **8** installations which rely on the Apache-based config in the Docker image. This uses the local-storage driver for uploads. Directus version **9** has a NodeJS based architecture and therefore doesn't suffer from this vulnerability.",
    "technicalDescription": "Any low-privileged user who has file upload permissions is able to upload webshells or other malicious PHP files which are stored in `/uploads/_/originals/`. If the server prevents execution of files in this directory the attacker can move the file into a subdirectory where they can upload a malicious `.htaccess` file which enables execution of PHP code:\n\n```\n<IfModule mod_php7.c>\n  php_flag engine on\n</IfModule>\n```\n\nServer-side command execution can be used to retrieve the Directus configuration and DB credentials to escalate in-app privileges, access password hashes or perform lateral network movement.",
