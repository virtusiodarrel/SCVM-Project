    "description": "Cygwin Git is vulnerable to an arbitrary code execution issue due to how, during a check out from a repository, arbitrary files can be overwritten.\n\nIf content from a malicious repository is checked out, arbitrary files and Git hooks could be overwritten with malicious content and allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "technicalDescription": "Cygwin Git is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution because crafted repositories that contain symbolic links as well as files that use backslash characters in their file names could cause an overwrite of arbitrary files, including Git hooks, during a check out of the repository.\n\nThis issue could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as soon as the repository is checked out.",
