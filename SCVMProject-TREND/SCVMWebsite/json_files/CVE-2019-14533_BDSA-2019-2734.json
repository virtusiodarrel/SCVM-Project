    "description": "VLC Media Player is vulnerable to denial-of-service due to the mismanagement of system memory resources. An attacker could cause a victim's instance of the application to crash by tricking them into running the application using a crafted file as input.",
    "technicalDescription": "The ASF demuxer component within VLC Media Player is implemented using code contained in a variety of scripts, including `asf.c` and `asf.h`. This code creates and manipulates a variety of in-memory buffers whenever a file is being parsed. These buffers are accessed using indices which are manipulated via pointer arithmetic. Under certain circumstances, the logic from which the pointers are derived and utilized may cause one or more pointers to be used after the corresponding memory buffer has been freed. This will raise an exception and halt program execution. An attacker could therefore cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by tricking a victim into running the program with a crafted file as input.",
