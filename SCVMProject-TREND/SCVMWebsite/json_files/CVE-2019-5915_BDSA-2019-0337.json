    "description": "An open redirect vulnerability has been discovered in OpenAM. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by a maliciously crafted web link to redirect victims to a controlled domain exposing them to phishing attacks.",
    "technicalDescription": "A weakness has been discovered in OpenAM which can lead to an open redirect vulnerability. It was discovered that the OAuth **2.0** validation process implemented in the application was insufficient and did not validate the endpoints correctly. The functionality located in the files `OAuth2Constants.java`, `AuthorizeRequestValidatorImpl.java` and `OAuth2Request.java` could be exploited by an attacker to forge a malicious redirect which could be distributed to victims to launch phishing attacks.",
