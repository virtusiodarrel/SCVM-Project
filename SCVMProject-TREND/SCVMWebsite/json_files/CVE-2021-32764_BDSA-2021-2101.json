    "description": "Discourse is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via the parsing and rendering of `YouTube` `Oneboxes`. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious web scripts and steal sensitive information such as authentication tokens and user session cookies.\n\n**Note:** `This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse's default Content Security Policy.`",
    "technicalDescription": "This issue occurs in the `plugins/lazy-yt/assets/javascripts/initializers/lazyYT.js`, `plugins/lazy-yt/assets/javascripts/lib/lazyYT.js`, and `plugins/lazy-yt/plugin.rb` files due to a lack of sanitization of user supplied data. It was mitigated by the introduction of `initLazyYt()`, `escape()`, and `sanitize_yt_id()`.",
