    "title": "baserCMS  Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Multiple Components",
    "description": "baserCMS contains a vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the insufficient validation of user supplied input. Attackers could execute arbitrary scripts within the web browser of a victim by tricking them into clicking a crafted link. This could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as browser cookies.",
    "technicalDescription": "This vulnerability exists within the following components: Edit feed settings, Edit widget area, Sub site new registration, New category registration. Attackers could exploit this by crafting malicious JavaScript to be input and executed in the file upload function category list, subsite setting list, widget area edit, and feed list on the management screen. The vendor addressed this by implementing user input validation to the affected components.",
